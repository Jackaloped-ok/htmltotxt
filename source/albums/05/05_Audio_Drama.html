      <p>The first disc of <strong>OST 5, <em>Now, Engage Yourself to Me...</em></strong><em> </em>has, peppered through its musical tracks, a thirteen part audio drama. It uses the series cast, and is excerpts of the Chiho Saito manga. There doesn't appear  to be much intent to tell the story coherently, just reenact various scenes, and they are generally quite short in length.</p>
      <p>These translations of the text are courtesy of Verthandi, with some of the titles belonging to Robert Paige &amp; The Utena Translation Project. Verthandi originally spelled 'Juri' as 'Jury', and 'duelists' as 'duellists'. I changed this because the dominant spellings have shifted over time.<br />

Utena: Noble...it was a word I had never heard before, but I somehow understood its
       mysterious meaning.
