-I Am a Perfect Circle, I Am a Perfect Globe, I Am-
Translation by Ayu Ohseki
Like the Comte de Saint-Germain, clad in red,
We crossed the wall of time and came from the Middle Ages:
My other selves and me
Just as though all are one and one is all,
Every being amounts to a single collective:
The great Earth of infinite shadow
Behold!
In the morning sky
There I am, clad in armor of gold, silver, and tin
Behold!
In the midday sky
There I am, clad in alchemy-garb of salt, sulfur, and mercury
Behold!
In the twilight sky
There I am, clad in three magics of light
Behold!
In the midnight sky
There I am, clad as Solomon with minerals, animals, and vegetation
And I, in the vast universe,
There I am, clad in a religious habit of the Holy Trinity unified
Bells all throughout the world ring
Countless equations of darkness
The spell-casting midwife
The eternal and eerie prophet
The angelic Monastery of the Temptation
The Father of the Sand’s great analysis
Ex cathedra forevermore
The cathedral of the lamp of truth
Sun, moon, stars, magic, witch
All you fathers
Who forced my birth
Now, right now, return to me
A great pilgrimage where I amount to «one»
The future me
The Dream of Scipio
The future me
The Key of Solomon
The future me
The Sefer Yetzirah
The future me
The Penitence of Adam
I will enter a perfect, undistorted circle
I am a perfect globe, I am
