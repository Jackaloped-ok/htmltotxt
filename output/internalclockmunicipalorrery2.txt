Internal Clock, Municipal Orrery
Translation by Yotaka
 (animelyrics.com)
Statue of the Reaper, its head spinning
A bell rings, as if to expand the subject
The rooster crows, the window opens
The Twelve Apostles are just like puppets
Continuing a grand procession without blinking
Ancient orrery (celestial clock)
Automatic
My twelve constellations
Zodiac
My
Zodiac
From ancient times in my body
A hundred towers rise up
Internal scenery, ideal city
Church in a graveyard, a monastery
The Earth's eye,
an example of movement
An intellectual statue, a
constellation of effort
An incomplete embryo,
the secret of death
A theater, a hospital, a museum
Man-made flesh, Grotta labyrinth,
a grand history of illusory architecture
Man-made clock, countless balances,
spinning round, an individual time
From the ancient city to me
Ending that day, one day's clock
Daytime is the sun,
night is the moon
One day's natural clock
BOON BOON KINKONKAN
BOON BOON KINKONKAN
The mystery of the internal city and clock
Geometric law, a construct of ticking clocks
Unchanging eternity
Modern perpetuity
Universal truth
Lack of variety
Infinite variety
I become a human city
I become a divided clock
City, clock, discovery
City, clock, understanding
City, clock
"Annihilation!"
