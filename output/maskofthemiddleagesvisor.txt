Mask of the Middle Ages: 'Visor'
Translation by Katie
Wiser
Time is a war of spiritual sacrifice.
The ramparts of dawn are being smashed apart.
Diving underground that old castle,
Wrapped in iron and flames, a person of darkness
Wiser
Wiser
Medieval mask
Emblazoned on the skin of the alchemist,
The phantom-figureâ€™s world, (to) alchemize
A spell chanted in the dark blue night
An experiment of unmeasurable patience, the glass bulb
Wiser
Wiser
Medieval mask
A million candles, a medicinal brick
Destiny and spirit and the full moon
Not even knowing time, the metal brings resoundancy
That gaze stays fixed on its own beliefs.

Medieval mask
Launch! Send a darkness arrow!
Come, fire an arrow of darkness!
That mystery, lightning
That mystery, insensate
That mystery, brutal
That mystery, unknown
