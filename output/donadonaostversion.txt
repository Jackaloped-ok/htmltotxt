Dona Dona (OST 2 Version)
Translation by EJ
One fine afternoon, on the road to the market
A cart rumbles along, carrying a calf
The adorable calf is going to be sold
It looks on with mournful eye
Dona dona dona dona – carrying the calf
Dona dona dona dona – the cart sways
Dona dona dona dona – carrying the calf
Dona dona dona dona – the cart sways
In the blue sky, on the breeze, a swallow wings swiftly by
The cart goes on towards the market, carrying the calf
In English:
How the winds are laughing
They laugh with all their might
Laugh and laugh the whole day through
And half the summer’s night!
