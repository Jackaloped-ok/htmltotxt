Virtual Star Embryology
Translation from Pioneer/Geneon
 Album Release (2005)
Ancient, perfect, deserted and in solitude
Air, atom, destiny-star
Yeah, child of earth
Conception
Fetus of philosophy
Egg, perfection, the origin of nurturing
Stamen, pistil, a piece of a seed
Yeah, child of earth
Growth
Child of philosophy
And
Moon	Mercury	   Venus
Sun	   Mars	   Jupiter
Saturn Fixed star	 Motive star
Further circulation, infinitely everlasting
A kind of organic engine
A kind of perpetual motion device
Ah, lost motion
I'm a lost motion
And
Moon	Mercury	   Venus
Sun	   Mars	   Jupiter Saturn
Fixed star	 Motive star
Further circulation, infinitely everlasting
A kind of organic engine
A kind of perpetual motion device
Ah, lost motion
I'm a lost motion
