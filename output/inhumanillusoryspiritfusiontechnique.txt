Inhuman Illusory Spirit Fusion Technique
Translation by EJ
Holy spirits have them
Devilish spirits have them
Ah, though you carry a grain of Heaven
Everyone has infernal ulterior motivesâ€“the good have them!
The evil have them!
Ah, though you hold the eeriness of Hell
As long as such suspicious figures come,
There shall be debate!
If it be so, on an awesome moonlit night
Come out and go astray!
This mystery is beyond the ken of Man
Humans, dwarfed by the vastness of Creation
Shall tremble in fear at that form!
