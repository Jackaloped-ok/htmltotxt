{Lewd Demonic Theory} Compilation-
Translation by EJ
In the territory of the future revival
Of completely forgotten, undying memories,
There is the girl with the obsessed eyes of Psyche
Is she natural?
A succubus?
An incubus?
In the spontaneous magical resonance
Of the beat that shrinks in uncertainty,
There is the girl who mimics a blood clock
Is she history?
A succubus?
An incubus?
Your relative existence
And my existence, which in truth should be absolute
Hermaphroditus
That is a natural book
I am a seventeenth-century emperor
Rudolf of the roses
A stern and serene emperor
In the longed-for pure/false album
Of the original elements of creation {Chronicle of Youth},
There is the girl disguised by firelight
Is she the sun?
A succubus?
An incubus?
In the mysterious lake of all creation
Of the silent boy-ghost,
There is the girl who mimics emptiness and daydreams
Is she temptation?
A succubus?
An incubus?
Absolute purity
A fated eternal revolution
A theory of human movement that is apocalypse
Two people
Hermaphroditism
Twins
Uncertainty
Two people
Hermaphroditism
Mystery
