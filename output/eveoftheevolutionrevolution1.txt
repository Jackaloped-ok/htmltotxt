(Eve of the Evolution Revolution)
Translation by allegoriest
The earth begins
as a stage
A loveless galaxy
The theory of other people
Unchanging illusions
The clock that solves riddles
The baby carriage
at the ends of immortality
The eternal me
The eternal Stranger
Two relationships
Two births
The mysterious libra
The constellation of the human body
ahh
Time is a theory, illusory
Beginning as I am born onto the stage
Destiny, choices and the theory of good bye
You and I are the river of heaven
There is no past, only the present, no future
In the theatre of the universe there is only one person
Thatâ€™s me! Wait!
My last evolution
revolution
everlution!
Last Evolution
