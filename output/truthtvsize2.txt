Truth (TV Size)
Translation by Robert Paige &
            Utena Translation Project (1998)
Missing truth and forever
Kissing love and true your heart
Embrace me with your true arms
The key to open up tomorrow is reality
I want to keep on destroying lies.
Even if we keep on talking,
you still won't ever see.
Excuses really suit adults
who hang on to old stories. Because unchosen angels have no             need for wings.
Missing truth and forever,
Kissing love and true your heart,
I will like tomorrow's new me.
At least I believe so; I want to believe it, so I want to keep lies hating me.

Missing truth & forever
Kissing love & true your heart
Hold me in your arms so true
Reality is the key to tomorrow
I want to keep destroying lies
Although we've said this much,
you still can't see
Excuses are suited to grown-ups
Who still cling to fairy tales
Unchosen angels even have no
need for wings
Missing truth & forever
Kissing love & true your heart
I believe that I'll love myself tomorrow
And because I want to believe,
I want to be hated by lies
