Magic Lantern Butterfly Moth 16th Century
Translation from Pioneer/Geneon
 Album Release (2005)
The troubles of old self
Although gripping tamed sword
with strength
Pitiful aging arms
Missing aim creates sword of wind
With tottering steps
The aged person!
Groaning sword of wind
Troy's watchtower of castle
Burning peak
Smashed with lightning
Polonius becomes deaf
for a while
Look! Gray haired old man!
The sword rose to slay
stopped in the sky
Polonius was petrified
Soon Polonius gained back his hostility
He charged at the aging king
with blood-dripping bloody sword!
