When Where Who Which
Translation from Pioneer/Geneon
 Album Release (2004)
When where who which
When where who which
Flowing blood of caged memories
The cradle of the millennium
I am an actor eternally metaphorical
Sphinx.
phinx of winter desert
Birth and death of the body
When you know the wind of sorrow
I'll be a saint actor eternally metaphorical
The dark light that falls into the abyss
- marginal
Brightly burn,
wake up and sing
Born to the world.
an instant birth
Keep repeating
