Virtual Star Embryology
Translation from Nozomi
 DVD Release (2011)
Ancient times. Perfection. Isolation in the desert.
Atmosphere. Atom. Causality star.
Yes, a child of earth is
conceived.
The embryo of philosophy.
Egg. Perfection. The origin in the nest.
Stamen. Pistil. A single seed.
Yes, a child of earth
grows.
The child of philosophy.
And then
lunar heaven! Mercurian heaven. Venusian heaven.
Solar heaven. Martian heaven. Jovian heaven.
Saturnian heaven. Stellar heaven. Motive heaven.
And then... The endless surface of the torus.
A single organic mechanism.
A single perpetual motion machine.
Ah, it is empty movement.
Just empty movement. Empty...
(Last four stanzas  repeated for full length
ending theme version.)
