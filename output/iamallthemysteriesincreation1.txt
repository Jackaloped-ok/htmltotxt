I Am All the Mysteries in Creation
Translation from Central Park Media
 DVD Release (2003)
An ode to the face
An ode to the head
An ode to the hair
An ode to the nails
An ode to the chest
An ode to both arms
An ode to both legs
An ode to the body
Their names are crests
The heraldry of the human body
The form I see in the mirror
Complex and subtle, Manners and mores
Black and white court etiquette
White and black in an ever-opposing pattern
People drawing complicated symbols
The art of history via baroque technique
Salamanders,
Dragons, Wild boars
Holy objects, Sacraments
Faith, Virtue
The sealed-away
miracle of the rose
The bloom of man and beast
Pearls and gems;
people and age
A crucifix of diamond flowers!
