 Album Release of OST 8 (2004)
SHURA, Now Burning
The driving force behind the hand,
SHURA, Now Feverish
None can know the final demise
A dark “Farewell”,
Throwing off its present self,
Blown to the wild darkness,
To the limits of the empty sky
SHURA, Now Silent
The gaze fixed on Earth's movement, Heaven, Humanity
SHURA, Now Ancient
If there is an End to the Universe
A musical “Farewell”
The blood melting,
Like wisps of steam,
So freezing to the touch
SHURA becomes the empty solitude,
In isolation to the depths of nothingness.
SHURA Like a firefly fading pale,
Standing on the edge of the hour of death
SHURA, Now Live
While a storm and a blat of hot air flow in whirls
SHURA, Now Glitter
On a constellation, a galaxy and a mane
A Fearful “Farewell”
In far and near
Mask of the nature’s soul
I form a body of the departed soul
SHURA, Now Silent
Every star rising to glory and power,
SHURA, Now Transforming
Thunder, Lightning, The Great Darkness
A tragic “Farewell”
Even to Eternity,
Finding a mate,
In the Heart of the Earth
SHURA becomes the livings stars,
The stars become their source.
SHURA Cradling countless eras to that mystic star,
The Core of Power  &middot; Corona
SHURA Milky Way
SHURA Andromeda
SHURA Orion
SHURA Cassiopeia
SHURA Kruger
SHURA Cepheus
SHURA Sirius
SHURA Sombrero
SHURA Magellan
SHURA, Now the limits of Chandrasekhar!
SHURA, Now the limits of Chandrasekhar!
SHURA, Now the limits of Chandrasekhar!
