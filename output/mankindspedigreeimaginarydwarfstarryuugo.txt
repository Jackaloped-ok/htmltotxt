Extrahuman Imagination Dwarf Star Hourglass
Translaiton by Katie
Shadows are moving.
That power:
Transformation.
Darkness is returning.
That power:
Revolution.
The right way is solving humanity's mysteries,
That rift ahead in the soul of existence,
Replying,
The Possibility
I
Alone
Can
attain.
The human realm, the earthly realm, the eternal realm.
The human realm, the earthly realm, never-ending.
The human realm, the earthly realm, oh, death and rebirth!
The human realm, the earthly realm, only repetition.
Virtual birth,
Virtual me,
Virtual relationships,
Virtual life,
Virtual earth:
Virtual planet.
Silence in spite of questioning:
Therefore,
Each and every
Thing unknowing,
Thing unknown.
