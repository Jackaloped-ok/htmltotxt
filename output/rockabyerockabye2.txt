Rock-a-bye, Rock-a-by(e)
Translation by Hiraku
Baroque ( rock )
Spiraling Baroque
Baroque ( rock )
Eros’ beloved
Ahh-Ah-Ah—Ah-Ah-Ah—
Angels of Bernini
Satyr of Puget
Baroque ( rock )
Loosening spiral of the torsion spring
Baroque ( rock )
Motion for the endless motion
Ahh-Ah-Ah—Ah-Ah-Ah—
Seashell, Gazelle
Bacteria, Semicircular canal
Freeform curvature
Meandering curvature
Swirling curvature
Logarithmic spiral
To be devoted is to be Baroque ( rock )!
In other words, Baroque is
To be moving
To be self-sustaining
To be ever-changing
In other words, Baroque is
To be inwardly centripetal
To be outwardly expanding, infinitely
To be eternal, To be endless, To be in the resonating motion!
O Time! Its compulsion! To be swayed and swerved!
Everything stands on the vertiginous knife-edge of imbalance
Going round and round! Dancing the flowing and decadent Le Rondo!
Liberate! Opening! For all!
Surround the center! The circle of nine commencing the dance of Le Rondo!
Liberate! Opening! For all!
Back and forth going
Baroque
Death then rebirth
Baroque Rock
