At Times, Love...
Translation by  Takayama Miyuki
This rose is our destiny, ripping us apart.
Our hands have been torn apart...
Even when I sleep,
as I embrace my thoughts and dreams for you,
they reach to the ends of the world!
At times, love is strong,
so much it even wounds people's hearts, but Ah
in the midst of the courage that grants our dreams,
a light always shines forth,
(becoming) a single power...
This rose is our destiny, leading us
to now meet once again.
Because I've never forgotten
our promise,
I've finally made it this far!
At times, love nobly
seeks out, to pierce people's hearts. Ah
The ones protected by the ones who protect
They always shine forth
To become a single power...
At times, love is strong,
so much it even wounds people's hearts, but Ah
in the midst of the courage that grants our dreams,
a light always shines forth.
Love is strong,
so much so that it can move people's hearts, but Ah
If we are together, then without a doubt
we can change the world, and everything will
become one power.
