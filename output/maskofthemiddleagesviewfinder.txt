Mask of the Middle Ages “Viewfinder”
Translation by EJ
Viseur
Time is a spiritual war of sacrifices
Smashing through the walls of dawn's fortress
Deep in the earth beneath that old castle
Is a man of darkness, wrapped in iron and flame

Mask of the Middle Ages
With alchemy burned into his skin
He will alchemize the world of phantoms
In the pale darkness of night, a spell of exorcism
Endurance experiments without number, spheres of glass

Mask of the Middle Ages - Viseur
A million candles, bricks of medicine
The sound of metal rings out, not knowing the time
Of fate and the heart and the full moon
To gaze at it would be to believe it

Launch! Send a darkness arrow!
Launch! Send a darkness arrow!
That mysterious thunder
That mysterious cruelty
That mysterious ruthlessness
There are none who know those mysteries
