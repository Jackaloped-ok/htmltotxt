Dawn Scat
Translation from Nozomi
 DVD Release (2011)
When one is in love, time stands still.
In a timeless world, the couple walks on.
The night is still, the stars never fade.
Only the echoes of a love song remain.
For a couple in love, even the clocks will stop.
Dawn Scat        Translated by Ayu Ohseki
When we love each other, this transient world comes to a halt
The two of us shall go on to a world without time
The night shall not flow, nor shall the stars fade
The song of love shall simply resound
We love each other, and so our clock comes to a halt
Our clock comes to a halt
Lu lu lu lu lu......

When one is in love, The world stands still
In a timeless world, The couple walks on
The night is still, the stars never fade
And only the echoes of a love song remain
For a couple in love
Even the clocks will stop
Loo loo loo loo loo.....
