Transparent Period of Adolescence
Translation from Central Park Media
 DVD Release (2002)
Vanish! Fade away! Melt away!
Disappear!
Any and all around me!
Vanish! Fade away! Melt away!
Disappear!
Instant ersatz people around me!
They, who betray my dreams!
They, who take vengeance on my hopes
I've had enough of this age!
I'm going to run!
Everything, begone!
There's nothing left for me to want!
Straddling an unmanned sidecar
Taking a fantasy journey of 3000 leagues
Subway, highway, airway
Here I go! At 100 km/h!
The wonder! The hurricane! The fugitive!
