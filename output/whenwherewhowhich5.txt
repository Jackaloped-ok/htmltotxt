When Where Who Which

When Where Who Which
When Where Who Which
Flow of blood from the cage of my memory,
In the cradle of a thousand years of bliss.
And I, an actor cast eternally
as the Sphinx in the desert winter,
Phinx.
Now you know the sadness
of the stillborn flesh.
And I, a holy actor, cast eternally
as a dark shining Margineaux,
cast into Hell.
Glow! Burn!
Cool down, and sing!
Born in this world,
born in an instant,
born all over again.
