A Sealed Spell
Translation from Pioneer/Geneon
 Album Release (2004)
A sealed spell without a mark
An unfortunate steel mask
Blue sky - sea - then a wind blows
The prairie - a rabbit - even a river runs through
Time and generations will not change
Time and generations are something but
they are not really there
Humans play a memory of blood
Humans are numbers in a flowing river
Humans just pass on the knowledge of
how to be human to the next generation
There is no change!
We can see during the daytime, but not at night
We can see during the night, but not in the daytime
Anagram
That's a word of mystery - a mask for a word
Its origin is Dich!
