and a Child of Darkness through Possibilityâ€•
Translation by Katie
Andromeda,
Tyrannosaurus,
Teatromeda,
Teatrosaurus.
Theatre nebula,
Theatre dinosaur.
Cosmic light,
My source,
The cosmos-stage.
The earth-actor.
Cassiopeia,
Triceratops,
Teatropeia,
Teatrotops,
Theatre nebula,
Theatre dinosaur.
Dual light,
Single source,
Androstage,
Actogynous.
Ourselves,
The Mesozoic Era arriving with the Triassic,
Adaptive scatteration,
Dying out at the Cretacious-Paleogene boundary,
Alamosaurus.
Ah,
Wearing that form,
Namely, non-avian dinosaur actors.
Systematics or fate?
The Dinosaur Renaissance
Connected by Majungasaurus (non-avian theropods)
You know!
It can go to you! The cosmos-theater.
The child of light, the child of darkness:
Teatromeda, Teatrosaurus.
The child of light, the child of darkness:
Teatromeda, Teatrosaurus
Teatromeda, Teatrosaurus.
Teatromeda, Teatrosaurus.
Teatromeda, Teatrosaurus.
Teatromeda, Teatrosaurus
Teatromeda Teatrosaurus
