The Inversion of Me and My Room
Translation by Verthandi
The umbilical cord, the rope that symbolizes life,
is the cosmic swing at the end of the cosmos
That cord, furiously swinging,
By the recoil, dances through space
The body revolves once in a somersault
I am of the great darkness that passes over rooftops,
The reverse of me in a single leap
The inverted, cheap apartment and
Two worlds; beyond written record
What is awakening?  Only the cord
A grand rotation in the city skies!
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, good-bye to whom?
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, good-bye-bye to me!
