Astragalus Earth Backgammon
Translation by Ayu Ohseki
Earth backgammon: by boat, by foot, by car
Holy repose: the dice's circle of
Earth backgammon: by sea, by land, by river
Holy throw: the dice's transmigration
The Book of Daniel, apocalypse: the Eternal Book, recurrence
"I live not for myself, myself
I live for the world, the world"
Earth backgammon: persecutory famine
Lewdness, massacre: the dice's darkness
Earth backgammon: imperial pestilence
The Holy Devil is the dice's judgement
The true nature of the Gods, the flames of ekpyrosis
"Even if I am burnt to nothing at all, at all
I live for the world, the world"
Earth's life span, ancient prophecy
The elements of all creation, natural revelation
All things are but one
That is
"My, mine, that is me, that which is me, that is called me"
One thing, one person, one's person, one's effort, one day
One self, one being, one human
That is namely
The name of the sea: myself
The name of the land: myself
The name of the heavens: myself
The name of me: myself
Myself myself
Myself myself
Myself myself
Myself Sophia
Myself myself myself Sophia
Myself myself Sophia
Myself Sophia myself Sophia
Myse So lf my Phi self A
Myself Sophia
My So se Phi lf A
I am Sophia
Sophia is me
