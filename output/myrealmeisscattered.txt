My real me is scattered
Translation by EJ
My real me is scattered
(scattered, scattered)
My real me is scattered
(scattered, scattered)

Like eternal cells

Like the painting technique of spattering
My real me is scattered
(scattered, scattered)
My real me is scattered
(scattered, scattered)

And speaks with your words
I am the one who moves under your power
And transforms in your dreams
Ah, my illusory, fantastical me
Is the one who transforms in my gaze
My me is my human body library
My me is my
My me is my
My me is my
Here and there, scattered, of course, scattered
My me is my
Here and there, scattered, of course, scattered
My me is my…
