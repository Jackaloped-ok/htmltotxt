I Am An Imaginary Living Body
Translation by Allegoriest
 (animelyrics.com)
Burning darkness, birthed dolls
They call it the theory of the way of man
To manipulate the world, a single existence
The rest are an imaginary puppetry
Subzero darkness, birthed creatures
Subject to the theory of the change of man
On the natural stage is the single origin of existence
Composed of an imaginary work of life
Encounter the birth of words, then doubt
Encounter the birth of knowledge, then manifest
Ah, where is when I am?
incantations, curses, mysteries, prayer and me
Stage, destiny, magic mirror
Full moon! Mysteriously phantasmagoric!!
I am a perishing imaginary living body
Full moon! Mysteriously phantasmagoric!!
I am a perishing imaginary destined body
Wanting time, without repose
Continuing to live as a hollow form
Desiring land, without hands without feet
Continuing to live as myself
A transparent spirit, a faint sigh
hah hah hah hah hah
