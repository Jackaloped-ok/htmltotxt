Me and My Room, Upside-Down
Translation by EJ
A living rope like an umbilical cord
Is a universe swing at the end of the universe
If that rope is shaken hard
The recoil will make it dance through space
My body turns one somersault
I cross the rooftops
And leap over my dark side in a single bound
The cheap apartment turned upside-down, and
Two worlds, outside of books
What's happening? Leave it to the rope:
A giant rotation in the sky above the city!
Bye bye bye bye — goodbye to whom?
Bye bye bye bye — goodbye to me
