Philosophical existence.
The realm of the
Grand Guignol of common magic.
A normal sigh. A heavy sigh.
A labored sigh. A grieving sigh. A pleasured sigh.
A collection of sighs.
A container of sighs.
A magnifying lens.
A normal sigh. A heavy sigh.
A labored sigh. A grieving sigh. A pleasured sigh.
A normal sigh. A heavy sigh.
A labored sigh. A grieving sigh. A pleasured sigh.
A normal sigh. A heavy sigh.
A labored sigh. A grieving sigh. A pleasured sigh.
A normal sigh.
Ha! Ha! Haaa!
In anything, there is no energy at all.
In everything, there is no wasted energy
The Absolute Being!        A breathing machine!
The Absolute Being! The anatomical
model of flesh
The Absolute Being! Like peeling the layers of a shallot
The Absolute Being! A supreme synthesis
Ah! Ah! The Celestial Revolution.
Ah! Ah! The synthesis of existence.
The birth of a new species?
The limit of human potential?
Both are frightened.
My heart is also pounding.
The hammer strikes time!
Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!
I, the time traveler, will open the door!
