Revive! Infinite History of the “Middle Ages!”
Translation by allegoriest
Creation of existence
Mysterious pleasure
Cog wheeled device
Holy decadence
Incomplete history
Gunpowder device
The eternal miracle I believe in
The immortal god I test
Oh, endless history of the middle ages
Be reborn in us
Production of life
The way of alchemy
Steam device
Possessed people
Electric magician
Lightning powered device
Amongst time in the pulse of an invisible demon
How will you play a demonic verse
On a hundred stringed koto
Oh, endless history of the middle ages
Be reborn in us
My entirety is in the middle ages
Schola abstract
My entirety is in the middle ages
Paralyzing thoughts
My entirety is in the middle ages
Book of ominous predictions
My entirety is in the middle ages
Spiritual magic regiment
Metallic foetus
Holy experiment
Eve of the future
Distillation of spirit and breath
Vitality of the decaying body
Embryonic reservoir bottle
My entirety is in the middle ages
Madness and stupidity
My entirety is in the middle ages
Medical science of astrology
My entirety is in the middle ages
Incoherent art of death
My entirety is in the middle ages
Optical antidote
Experiment of fright
Experiment of agony
Experiment of cruelty
Experiment of gloom
Experiment of gunpowder smoke
Experiment of eyes
Experiment of dissection
Experiment of wretchedness
History of passion
History of cruel eyes
History of epilepsy
History of convulsions
History of insanity
History of hemorrhaging
History of skewed flesh
History of organ consumption
Oh, be reborn
Endless history of the middle ages!
“Our soul
Our spirit
In our flesh”
Oh, be reborn
Endless history of the middle ages!
“In our eyes
In both our hands
In our blood and breath”
Be reborn! Endlessly
Be reborn! Become history
Be reborn! Be reborn!
Middle Ages, That entirety, the time!
The room! The clothes!
