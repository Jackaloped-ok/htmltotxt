Spira Mirabilis Theater
Translation by allegoriest
Theatre. Special souls, a collective event
Theatre. Special personalities, a daydream of reality
An operating table- a wrecked ship. The pure flow of the play
Spira Mirabilis
Whirlpools, spirals, Continuing to change
Spira Mirabilis
Scipio's Dream
Theatre. Illusory souls
Immortalised events
Theatre. Illusory personalities
An immortal construct
Ammonite shells, alchemy. The sacred scarab
Spira Mirabilis
Living once more so that we may die
Spira mirabilis
ahh, the miraculous spiral
my, my, my, my
my, my, my, my
Endless theatre
The geometrical stage
Life and death's secrets
The curtain will always come down.
Death Rebirth Death Rebirth
Death Rebirth Death Rebirth
Death Rebirth Death Rebirth
