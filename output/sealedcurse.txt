Sealed Curse
Translation by Yotaka
 (animelyrics.com)
An unwritten sealed curse
An iron mask of misfortune
Blue skies - sea - and the wind blows
Meadows - rabbit - even the river flows
Time, the era does not change
Time, the era is existant and
non-existant things
Man is described by the blood of "make-believe"
Man is swept away in a river of "teachings"
All a man can become
is what he is taught to be
Without change!
Visible in the day, invisible at night
Visible at night, invisible in the day
Anagram
Those enigmatic words, masks of words
The source of it all is yourself!
