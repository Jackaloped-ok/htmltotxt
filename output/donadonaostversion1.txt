Dona Dona (OST 5 Version)
Translation by EJ
One fine afternoon, on the road to the market
A cart rumbles along, carrying a calf
The adorable calf is going to be sold
It looks on with mournful eye
Dona dona dona dona – carrying the calf
Dona dona dona dona – the cart sways
Dona dona dona dona – carrying the calf
Dona dona dona dona – the cart sways
In the blue sky, on the breeze, a swallow wings swiftly by
The cart goes on towards the market, carrying the calf
'If only I had wings to fly,
I'd be able to return to my pleasant pasture'
Dona dona dona dona – carrying the calf
Dona dona dona dona – the cart sways
Dona dona dona dona – carrying the calf
Dona dona dona dona – the cart sways
Dona dona dona, dona dona dona, dona
