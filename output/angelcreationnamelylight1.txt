Angel Creation, Namely, Light
Translation by Yotaka
 (animelyrics.com)
Natural light
Mosaic light
Child of the Morning, the angel Lucifer
Apocalyptic light
Michael's light
Child of Darkness, androgynous
Firey light
Eternal light. Heavenly light
The heirarchy of the heavens
Illusory light
Eternal light
An imaginary deception
A capricious birth
Nyx (Dark Night)
Erebos (Faint Darkness)
Uranus (Starry Sky)
Thanatos (Death)
Shining with light,
the spherical body
Gynous
Born from all miracles,
Gynous
Principle of pleasure
Principle of nirvana
Death's inevitability, named the light
Alive and moving,
the object of life
Wandering in the universe of the mind,
The form of life
Infinity, perfection
Seeking eternity!
Namely the incompleteness
of returning to the beginning
Both sexes, both poles
Two of me
Up and down, left and right
Two of me
Front and back, heaven and earth
Two of me
Angel, devil
Two of me
Inside is nothingness
Inside is nothingness
(repeat)
