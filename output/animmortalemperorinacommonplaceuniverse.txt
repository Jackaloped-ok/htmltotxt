An Immortal Emperor in a Commonplace Universe
Translation by EJ
Existence, wonder, alchemy
Base metals, precious metals
From right to left,
Beginning and ending
Destruction, a hunt, a wild dance, a feast
Nativity, invisibility, alchemy
An artificial recomposition device
From top to bottom
Transformation and strangeness
Books, anonymity, dissolution, disgrace
The world is unchangeable (I)
I am unchangeable
Unchangea changeable,
able-un ble-unchange,
Unchangeable
Stop!
The fruitless struggle of birds and fish
Stop!
The mutual cheating of eggs and bets
Stop!
The ancient dance from boats and carriages
Stop!
Going on ahead to seas and waterfalls
A sparkling dream, a wavering imagination
A scorching reverie, a slithing idea
A rustling delusion, a fluttering thought
A flickering creativity, a heart-pounding supposition
Birth, immortality, alchemy
Time, space, an egg of the universe
Philosophy, jewel, Rosae Crucis
Purity, harmony, perspective
I am future, past, and present
I am future, past, and present
A sparkling origin, a wavering loneliness
A scorching maze, a slithing space-time
A rustling reminiscence, a fluttering memory
A flickering disappearance, a heart-pounding immortality
I am future, past, and present
I am future, past, and present
