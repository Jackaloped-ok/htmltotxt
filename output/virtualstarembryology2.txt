Virtual Star Embryology
Translation by EJ
Antiquity, perfection, alone in the desert
Atmosphere, atom, a star of causality
Yes, the child of earth
Is conceived
The embryo of philosophy
Egg, perfection, an origin in a nest
Stamen, pistil, a single seed
Yes, the child of earth
Grows up
The child of philosophy
And then
The sphere of the moon, the sphere of Mercury, the sphere of Venus
The sphere of the sun, the sphere of Mars, the sphere of Jupiter
The sphere of Saturn, the sphere of fixed stars, the sphere of mobile stars
The torus continues into eternity, endlessly
A single organic engine
A single perpetual motion device
Ah, it is empty motion
Yes, it is empty motion
And then
The sphere of the moon, the sphere of Mercury, the sphere of Venus
The sphere of the sun, the sphere of Mars, the sphere of Jupiter
The sphere of Saturn, the sphere of fixed stars, the sphere of mobile stars
The torus continues into eternity, endlessly
A single organic engine
A single perpetual motion device
Ah, it is empty motion
Yes, it is empty motion, motion
