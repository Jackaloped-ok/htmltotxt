Utopian Past Tense Incantation
Translation from Nozomi
 DVD Release (2011)
Time machine!
To the past, to the future! Whoosh! Zoom!
Time machine!
Back to when I wasn a precious young child.
On a carpet of lotus blossoms.
Playing with my dolls.
That wonderous spell! Fi! Fi!
Hard candy...
That pretty dress I wore.
The 7-5-3 festival.
Oh, my dream machine!
A shower of cherry blossoms.
Taking me to my distant, past self...
Ten! Two! One! Zero!
Take off!
Time machine!
To the past, to the future! Whoosh! Zoom!
Time machine!
Back to those days of dreams and hope.
Tying my hair back.
A lunch-box in my hand!
That wonderous spell! Fi! Fi!
Amusement parks.
Surprise! Shock!
My heart         cries out,
"Oh, my dream machine!"
A storm of dreams!
Taking me to my distant, past self
Ten! Two! One! Zero!
Take off!
