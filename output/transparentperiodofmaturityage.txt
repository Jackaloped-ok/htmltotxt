Transparent Period of Maturity Age
Translation from Pioneer/Geneon
 Album Release (2005)
Vanish! Fade away! Melt away!
Get lost!
Every single thing
Vanish! Fade away! Melt away!
Get lost!
Instant fake things
Betray by a hope
Vengeance through a wish
I'm sick of the time of such an era
I run away
Get lost- everything!
I no longer want anything!
Driving a driverless side car
An imaginary journey of three thousand miles
Subway, high speed, airport
Let's go 100 miles an hour
Mysteriously powered, a gale, a fugitive
