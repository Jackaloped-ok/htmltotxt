-Tales of the Bronze Figurine Actors-
Translation by Ayu Ohseki
Formless, timeless, music strums
The sounds of the harp folk orchestra
Someone blows a whistle
And when they do, they appear
As if gushing forth from all over:
The figurine actors
The bronze figurine actors
The stage lights illuminate a spot in a vast sea of sand
They shine with the light of the moon, the stars, with infinity variety
Searchlights facing the heavens
And when they do, they come from all over
From the reaches of the sand-sea, from that era:
The figurine actors
The bronze figurine actors
They, the figurine actors, all
Gather at center stage
To emit the calls of all sorts of creatures
To mimic the motions of all sorts of creatures
And light flames here and there through the theatre
Orpheus’s Cavern Theatre
Orpheus’s Cavern Theatre
Orpheus’s Cavern Theatre
Orpheus’s Cavern Theatre
On programme:
Marmontel’s play, “Cleopâtre”
Vaucanson’s “The Exquisite Toys”
Robert-Houdin’s “The Digesting Duck”
Leonard Mälzel’s “Panharmonicon”
The Mannerism period figurine actors shall go
The Mannerism period figurine actors shall come
The Mannerism period figurine actors shall leave
The Mannerism period figurine actors shall tell a tale
The Mannerism period figurine actors shall sing a song
And when they do
The world shall dance through the cosmos
