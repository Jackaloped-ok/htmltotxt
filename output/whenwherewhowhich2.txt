When Where Who Which
Translation by EJ
when where who which
when where who which
The flow of blood from the cage of memory
In the cradle of the Thousand-Year Kingdom
I am an actor,
cast for eternity
As a sphinx-phinx in the winter desert
Now you know the mournful wind
Of flesh born to die
A holy actor,
cast for eternity
As a darkly shining marginaux fallen into Hell
Shine! Burn!
Cool down, and sing!
I am born into this world
for but a moment
Which repeats
