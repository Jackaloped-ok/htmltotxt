I Am All the Mysteries in Creation
Translation by Verthandi
An ode to my
face,
my neck,
my hair
An ode to my nails
and my torso
An ode to my hands
and my feet
This is an ode to all the parts of my body
In other words, a crest;
This is the heraldry of the human body
That figure in the mirror
Performs delicate work in a complex situation
Charge argent on field sable; courtly ettiquette
Charge sable on field argent; shield-shaped design
People arrayed in impenetrable symbol
The historical art of the Baroque
The Salamander
The Dragon and the Urchin
The hidden miracle of the Eucharist
Creed and virtue
Kept in confinement,
The miracle of the rose
Human-beast-flower
Pearl and jewel
The age of man
Floral diamond and cross
Or, Argent, Purpure, Vert, Gules, Azure, Sable

The cave, the statue, the fountain, the gardens, the palace
The bronze mural, the imaginary castle, the villa
Far and near
I am all the Mysteries
From near and far
I am all the Mysteries
I am all the Mysteries in Creation
I am all the Mysteries in the World
