Be Reborn! Neverending History of the “Middle Ages”
Translation by EJ
The creation of life
A mysterious pleasure
A gear device
Sacred decadence
Unfinished history
A bottled nitrate device
Believing in the eternal miracle
The immortal god is tested
Ah, infinite history of the 'Middle Ages'
Be reborn in me
The structure of existence
An alchemist with high morals
A vapor device
Possessed characters
An electric conjurer
A lightning device
Time is pounded to the beat of hidden devils
Why is the hundred-stringed koto's
Demonic musical passage played?
Ah, infinite history of the 'Middle Ages'
Be reborn in me
Turn my whole self into the 'Middle Ages'
A scholar of the abstract
Turn my whole self into the 'Middle Ages'
A paralyzed ideology
Turn my whole self into the 'Middle Ages'
An inauspicious prediction
Turn my whole self into the 'Middle Ages'
A sorcerous encampment of the heart
A metal embryo
A sacred experiment
Eve of the future
Distillation of the spirit
Vitality of a tainted body
Embryo storage jar
Turn my whole self into the 'Middle Ages'
Madness and stupidity
Turn my whole self into the 'Middle Ages'
Astrological medicine
Turn my whole self into the 'Middle Ages'
Euthanasia by rumor
Turn my whole self into the 'Middle Ages'
Optical antidote
An experiment in surprise
An experiment in pain
An experiment in cruelty
An experiment in agony
An experiment in gunsmoke
An experiment in eyeballs
An experiment in carving and squeezing
An experiment in gloom
The history of temper
The history of the whites of the eyes
The history of epilepsy
The history of convulsions
The history of insanity
The history of blood congestion
The history of distorted flesh
The history of digestive organs
Ah, be reborn
Infinite history of the 'Middle Ages'
'In my soul
In my heart
In my flesh'
Ah, be reborn
Infinite history of the 'Middle Ages'
'In my eyeballs
In both my hands
In my blood and breath'
Be reborn! Infinite
Be reborn! History
Be reborn! Be reborn!
The 'Middle Ages,' that time of everything
The rooms! The clothing!
