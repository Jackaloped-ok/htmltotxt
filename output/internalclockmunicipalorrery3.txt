Internal Clock, Municipal Orrery
Translation by Verthandi
An image of Death rocks my mind
I pull the cord; toll the bells
The cock beats its wings; when the window opens
The twelve disciples are mere dolls
Unblinking, a grand parade
The old orrery (clock of astronomy)
An automatic mechanism
The twelve constellations of the ecliptic me:
The zodiac
I,
The zodiac
Within my body, from olden times,
One hundred towers rise above
A visceral landscape; Utopia
In the cemetary, a church, a cloister
Eye of Earth;
motive specimen
Intellectual organ of stone;
the sign of Motive Power
Unfinished embryo;
the secrets of Death
The theater, the hospital, the historical museum
Artificial flesh; grotta; Labyrinth;
illusionary construction; marble
Artificial clock; weight; spring;
spinning and turning; individual time
From the ancient city to me,
It ends with that day, quotidian clock
The sun in daytime;
the moon at night
The natural clock of a day
Bong bong, ding dong ding,
Bong bong, ding dong ding.
The corporeal city and the Mystery of the clock
Geometric law, puritanical construction
Monotony; eternity
The present; perpetuity
All Creation is reality
Monotonous
Infinitely changing
I will take the form of a corporeal city
I shall take the form of a suspended clock
Municipal clock, a discovery
Municipal clock, an understanding
Municipal clock...
"Annihilation!"
