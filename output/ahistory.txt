A History
Translation by Verthandi
A small existance at the bottom of a hermetic dish;
Kushpadme, the dragon's child;
The natural magic in hereditary ages.
"I am here.
For smallness,
I am here."
Prehistoric appendix of destiny;
Mystification's child
"I am here.
For subtlety,
I am here."
Design and
Eccentricity and
Mutation and
Frenzied work
Unknowing
Immoral
Uncalculated
Unrefined
The cave, Rudolph Labyrintos
In the domain of pure thought.
The cave, Rudolph Labyrintos
In the domain of poetic creation.
The cave, Rudolph Labyrintos
In the domain of failed experiments.
The cave, Rudolph Labyrintos
In the domain of silent mentality.
The timbre of the flageolet
Secondhand, as it becomes melting air.
"I am here,
A breath in a water droplet-theater
As I turn to vapor in this petite opera."
Solitude!
Yes!
Solitude, solitude, solitude, solitude......
