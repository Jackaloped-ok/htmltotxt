(Eve of the Evolution Revolution)
Translation by Takayama Miyuki
 (animelyrics.com)
Beginning of the earth
Stage props
Laplace nebula
Spectatorism
Unchanging illusion
Mystery-solving clock
Baby carriage
of the edge of immortality.
My eternal self
The eternal stranger
Two relations
Two births
Scales of mystery
Human constellation
Aaaa
Aaaa
Time is hypothetical, an illusional prop
of the beginnings of birth.
Destiny, choice, goodbye-ism
You and I are the Milky Way
Having no past, only the present, having no future
Just one person in the theatre cosmic
That's me! Wait! My last evolution
revolution
everlution
