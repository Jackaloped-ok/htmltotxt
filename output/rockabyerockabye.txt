Translation by EJ
Baroque (rock)
The spiral is of the baroque
Baroque (rock)
An Eros-esque favorite
Aaaaaah
Bernini's angel
Puget's shepherd god
Baroque (rock)
The spiral is a loosening spring
Baroque (rock)
Endless movement for the sake of movement
Aaaaaah
A shell–that of an antelope
Bacteria, semicircular canals
Freedom curve
Meandering curve
Spiral curve
Logarithmic spiral
Baroque (rock) plays favorites
In other words, Baroque is
That which moves
That which endures
That which transforms
In other words, Baroque is
That which shrinks towards the center
That which expands limitlessly outwards
Resonating with an eternal, endless movement
Brandished at the compulsion of time
Standing on the horizon of every inequality
In the circle of the flowing dance of decadence
It aims for every liberation, every opening-up
In the circle of the nine dances that rotate around the center
It aims for every liberation, every opening-up
Repetition of comings and goings, Baroque
Death and rebirth, Baroque
Repetition of comings and goings, Baroque
Death and rebirth, Baroque
