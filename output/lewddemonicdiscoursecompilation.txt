《Lewd Demonic Discourse》Compilation―
Translation by Katie
Everlasting memory, forgotten:
In the land of that future rebirth,
There is a girl with the spellbinding eyes of Psyche.
Is she nature?
Succubus?
Incubus?
A rhythm receding in fear:
In that symphony of nature magic,
There is a girl who imitates the blood-clock.
Is she nature?
Succubus?
Incubus?
Your relative existence and
The truth of my absolute ideal existence,
Hermaphroditus:
That is from a book of the heavenly bodies.
I will become the seventeenth-century emperor,
Rudolf of Roses.
I will become a stern, peaceful emperor.
The original elements (boyhood records) of creation:
In that longed-for album of sincere untruths,
There is a girl masked in flame.
Is she the sun?
Succubus?
Incubus?
The reticent boy-ghost:
In that unfathomable lake of the universe,
Complete emptiness—there is a girl who simulates fantasy.
Is she temptation?
Succubus?
Incubus?
Absolute purity,
The eternal revolution of fate,
The apocalypse, becoming Homo movens theory
Two people,
Androgynous,
Twin
Uncertainties.
Two people,
An androgynous,
Miraculous
Seal.
