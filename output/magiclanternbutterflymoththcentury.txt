Magic Lantern Butterfly Moth 16th Century
Translation from Nozomi
 DVD Release (2011)
Oh, how pitiful
The man puts all his power
into his familiar, old sword,
but his aging arms feel pity.
His aim falls short,
the old man staggers
and falls as the blade whiffs.
The howl of the sword's swing.
The Watchtowers of Troy
with flaming tops flash with lightning
and come crashing down.
Pyrrhus becomes
deaf for a time.
Behold! White-haired old man!
The sword raised to slay you
has frozen in the sky!
Pyrrhus is completely still!
But after a moment, Pyrrhus' animosity returns
And his hot-tempered sword of blood
takes aim at the aged king, and cuts him down.
