Virtual Star Embryology
Translation from Central Park Media
 DVD Release (2002)
Ancient times, Perfection, Isolation in the desert
Atmosphere, Atom Causality star
Yes, a native child is
conceived
The embryo of philosophy.
Egg, Perfection The origin in the nest
Stamen, Pistil A single seed
Yes, a native child
grows
The child of philosophy
And then
lunar heaven! Mercurian heaven, Venusian heaven,
Solar heaven, Martian heaven, Jovian heaven,
Saturnian heaven, Stellar heaven, Motive heaven.
And then.... The endless surface of the Taurus
A single organic mechanism
A single perpetual motion machine
Ah, it is empty motion
Just empty motion, That's what it is
(Last four stanzas  repeated for full length
ending theme version.)
