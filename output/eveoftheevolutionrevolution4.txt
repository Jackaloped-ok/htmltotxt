(Eve of the Evolution Revolution)
Translation by Robert Paige &
            Utena Translation Project (1998)
Beginning of the earth
Stage props
the Laplace nebula
Spectatorism
Unchanging illusion
Mystery solving clock
Baby carriage of the
edge of immortality.
My eternal self and
the eternal stranger
two relations;
two births
scales of mystery;
human constellation
Ahhh
Ahhh
Time is hypothetical, an illusional prop
of the beginnings of birth.
Destiny, choice, goodbye-ism
You and I are the Milky Way
Having no past, only the present, having no future,
A single person in the Theatre Cosmic.
That's me! Wait! My last evolution
revolution
everlution
Last Evolution
