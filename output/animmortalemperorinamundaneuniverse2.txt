An Immortal Emperor in a Mundane Universe
Translation by Verthandi
Existance: wonderous alchemy
Base metals; precious metals
From right to left,
Start to end,
Destruction, the hunt, a frenetic dance, a celebration banquet
Birth: unviewable alchemy
Apparatus of artificial recombination
From top to bottom,
A metamorphosis into a curious shape
Books, anonimity, self-indulgence, wildness
An unchanging world (I am)
I am unchanging
Ka Wa Ra Wa Ra Zu Ra
Zu Ka Zu Ka Wa
Unchanging
It ends:
The wasted labors of foul and fish
It ends:
The deceptive game of the egg and bed
It ends:
The ancient dance from the boat and carriage
It ends:
The anticipation of the sea and waterfall
Glittering reverie, flickering imagination
Parched vision, slithering expression
Murmuring delusion, flittering thought
Fluttering invention, trembling supposition
Birth: immortal alchemy
The cosmic egg of time and space
Philosophic crystal, Rosicrucianism
Purity, harmony, and perspective
The future, past, and present me
The future, past, and present me
Glittering origin, flickering solitude
Parched labyrinth, slithering space-time
Murmuring reminiscence, flittering memory
Fluttering evaporation, trembling immortality
The future, past, and present me
The future, past, and present me
