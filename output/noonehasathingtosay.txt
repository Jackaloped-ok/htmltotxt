No One Has a Thing to Say
Translation from Central Park Media
 DVD Release (2000)
No one has a thing to say.
There's nothing to be said about anything.
Except in the enclosed darkness called yesterday.
Except in the momentary flash of light called now.
Except in the theater, in the dark awaiting light, called
tomorrow.
Someone may have a thing to say.
There may be something to be said after all.
Except in the enclosed darkness called memory,
Except in the momentary flash of light called creation.
Except in the theater, in the dark awaiting light called
tomorrow.
Oh dance! In the ancient continent's theaters...
...for the performers who wear the mask of time.
Oh, dance! Your dreams,
three of the seven wonders of the world...
...carried here on the Galatic Railroad.
Like a star,
light a firefly,
A flash and it's born, a flash and it fades.
A flash and it's born, a flash and it fades.
Born and then gone, just like us all.
A flash and it's born, a flash and it fades.
Born and then gone, just like my jewel.
A flash and it's born, a flash and it fades.
Born and then gone, just like my star.
The first star. My star.
A flash and it fades, the firefly star...
