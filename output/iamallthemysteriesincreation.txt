I Am All the Mysteries in Creation
Translation from Nozomi
 DVD Release (2011)
An ode to the face.
An ode to the neck.
An ode to the hair.
An ode to the nails.
An ode to the chest.
An ode to both hands.
An ode to both feet.
An ode to the whole body.
In other words, a crest.
The heraldry of the human body.
The form I see in the mirror.
Both subtle and complex, a well-known design.
White spots on black cloth, courtly etiquette.
Black spots on white cloth, in the form of a shield.
People clad in unintelligible symbols.
The artistic history of the Baroque.
Salamanders.
Dragons. Porcupines.
The Eucharist. A sacrament.
Faith. Virtue.
The sealed-away
miracle of the rose.
The bloom of man and beast.
Pearls and gems,
people and age.
A cross of flowers!
