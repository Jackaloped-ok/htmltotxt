Scholastic Reproduction or Flesh Apocalypse
Translation by Katie
Phlegm, blood, moisture, bile
In other words, flesh apocalypse
The filthy breeze inside my nose
The filthy sea in my inner throat
The filthy darkness inside my belly
Excrement, erotes, reproduction
Carnal desire, sexual desire, passionate desire, selfish desire
In other words, form apocalypse
The breeze of the beast in the shadows in my mind
The demonic sea inside my soul.
The ugly darkness at the end of my libido
Self-restraint, sorcery, erotes, reproduction

Sap-stained dialectics
Fluid-stained dialectics
Debauchery-stained dialectics
Eros, agape, gnosis
Carpocrates
Pleasure becoming fate,
We transcend, becoming the impossible object.
Forgetting and casting away our selves,
We forget, becoming caught in vague inclinations
Yes, resounding, ascending, bearing fruit, being
Yes, exchanging, filling, emptying, becoming
