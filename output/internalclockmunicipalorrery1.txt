Internal Clock, Municipal Orrery
Translation from Central Park Media
 DVD Release (2003)
The figure of Death, his head shaking.
The rope tightens, the bell rings.
The rooster flaps, the window opened.
The 12 Apostles, like statues!
In a flash, the grand parade begins!
The ancient orrery,
automatic device!
12 constellations arrayed around me.
A zodiac.
I am
the zodiac!
Inside my body is ancient.
There, a hundred towers stand.
My internal organs, an ideal city.
In the graveyard, an abbey, and a church.
The eyeball of Earth.
An example of motion.
The stony viscera of intellect.
A dynamic constellation.
The incomplete embryo.
A mystery of death.
Theaters, hospitals, museums.
Manmade flesh, the grotta and labyrinth.
Illusory architecture of marble.
Manmade clocks, with bells and springs.
Whirling round and round, marking time.
From the ancient city to me...
Ending on that day, the 24-hour clock.
The sun showing at noon
...and at night, the moon.
Nature's 24-hour clock.
Bong, bong! Ding-dong-ding!
Bong, bong! Ding-dong-ding!
The city of flesh, the mystery of the clock.
Geometric law, rigid construction.
Monotony, eternity.
Present, permanence.
The truth of all creation:
Unending sameness.
Infinite variety.
I am the decaying human city.
I am the decaying, broken clock.
City, clock, discovery!
City, clock, revelation!
City, clock, annihilation!
