No One Talks About It
Translation from Pioneer/Geneon
 Album Release (2004)
Nobody talks about it
There is nothing to talk about
There is just the shut in darkness of yesterday
There is just an instant twinkling of the present
There is just the darkness waiting for the light of
tomorrow in the theater
There is the possibility to be anybody
There is the possibility to be anything
There is just the shut in darkness of memory
There is just an instant twinkling of creation
There is just the darkness waiting for the light of
tomorrow in the theater
Ah-ah dance, entertainers with masks of time in
the ancient continental theater
Ah-ah dance - like stars, the 3 sets of the seven
wonders from the Galaxy Express you long for
Be like a firefly
Born with the light, die with the light
Born with the light, die with the light
To be born and then to die, that is us
Born with the light, die with the light
To be born and then die, my beauty
Born with the light, die with the light
To be born and then to be dead, my star
The first star of evening is my star
Light up and then die, a firefly star
