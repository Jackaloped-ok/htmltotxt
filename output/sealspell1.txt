Seal Spell
Translation by allegoriest
The ancient sealing spell
The iron mask of misfortune
blue skies, the sea, and then the wind blows
Rabbits in the fields and rivers flow
Time and age are not something that change.
Time and age are something,
and yet nothing at all.
The pretend 'meaning' we've given to blood is the record we give of man
Man too is swept away in their 'teachings'
People also become people
simply to give these mere words
Nothing changes!
We see in the day what we can't see at night
We see at night what we can't see in the day
Anagram
Those mysterious words. That mask of words.
Their origin becomes ... You.
