Angel Creation, Namely, Light
Translation from Central Park Media
 DVD Release (1999)
Universal light,
mosaic light.
Lucifer, son of dawn.
Apocalyptic light,
Michael’s light.
Androgynous, son of darkness.
Flaming light,
heavenly light.
The hierarchy of heaven.
Illusory light,
eternal light.
Tricks of the mind,
capricious birth.
Nicocus,
Erebus,
Uranus,
Thanatos.
The globe of
Gyunus,
shining with light.
Gyunus,
in every way born in miracles.
The pleasure principle,
the Nirvana principle.
The certainty of death, namely light.
Life is merely
the moving shadow of the living.
In the universe of the mind,
the drifting shape of the living.
Light, temporary existence.
Seeking eternity,
namely the folly
of returning to the beginning.
Two sexes, two poles,
two of me.
Up, down, left, right,
two of me.
Front, back, heaven, earth,
two of me.
Angel, devil,
two sides of me.
And inside, I’m hollow.
Inside, I’m hollow.
Inside, I’m hollow.
