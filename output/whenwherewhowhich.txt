When Where Who Which
Translation from Nozomi
 DVD Release (2011)
When? Where? Who? Which?
When? Where? Who? Which?
Flowing blood of caged memories.
The cradle of 1000 years of bliss.
I am an actor, eternally metaphorical.
Just like the sphinx,
phinx of the winter desert.
You know the winds of sadness
of the body in both birth and death
The holy actor, eternally metaphorical.
The dark light that fell into the abyss,
marginal.
Brightly burn!
Awaken and sing!
Born into the world!
Birth of a moment!
Over and over again!
