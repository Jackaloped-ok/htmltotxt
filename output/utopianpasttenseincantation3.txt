Time Machine
To the past, to the future, whoosh, zip, zoom!
Time Machine
My childhood when I was so adorable.
Making a lotus carpet,
Playing with dolls,
A mysterious charm, Fi! Fi!
Candy
I wore a beautiful kimono
Children's Festival
Oh, my dream machine...
Flowerstorm
To the faraway ancient me,
Ten, two, one, zero...
Take off!
Time Machine
To the past, to the future, whoosh, zip, zoom!
Time Machine
To the time of all my dreams and wishes
Hair tied back,
toting a box lunch,
A mysterious charm, Fi! Fi!
Amusement parks
Surprise! Surprise!
These are all my soul
Oh, my dream machine...
Dreamstorm
To the faraway ancient me,
Ten, two, one, zero...
Take off!
