Truth
Translation from Pioneer/Geneon
 Album Release (2004)
Missing truth & forever
Kissing love & your true heart
Embrace me with your arms of truth
A key to open tomorrow is reality
I want to keep destroying lies...
I can't see anything in you
Even if we keep on talking
The annoying boy who wants to know me,
but I just want him to misunderstand me
Excuses are suited for grown-ups
who cling on to a story from the past
Wings are not needed for those angels who didn't
become chosen ones
Missing truth & forever
Kissing  love & your true heart
I believe in liking tomorrow's self because
I want to believeI want to be hated by the lies...
Make that a memory
Keep it warm and alone
You can't see a red fruit that I want
Don't notice a sigh
It'll be too late for crying tomorrow
I'm even longing for a slight fever that brings the
gusty windy night
Missing truth & forever
Kissing  love & your true heart
Just like a midnight child
I stop crying and keep knocking
On a door to look for love...
