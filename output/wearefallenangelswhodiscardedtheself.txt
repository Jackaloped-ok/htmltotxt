We are Fallen Angels who Discarded the Self
Translation by Ayu Ohseki
"We are whimsical angels
With traces of wings on our backs"
I considered myself
A child of man, therefore
I called myself a child of man
I considered myself
A child of man, therefore
I remained in the world of children of men
And forgot myself in mystery-strewing wisdom
Tearing off the sacred wings
Bestowed upon the clan of Heaven
The child of dawn, fallen from Heaven
I am a being who lives whimsically
"Not only I, but all people are
Fallen angels who discarded the self"
Seraphim, cherubim, thrones
Dominions, powers, virtues
"Not only I, but all people are
Fallen angels who discarded the self"
In the darkness of the Scholastic Period
It resounded
The angelic doctor, Doctor Angelicus
《The Book of Thomas Aquinas》 too now is absent
It roared
The seraphic doctor, Doctor Seraphicus
《Bonaventure's Angelic Treatise》 too implies, implies, implies...
"Not only I, but all people are
Fallen angels who discarded the self"
The Holy Book, Isaiah, Ezekiel
Moses, Solomon, the Old Testament era
"I am myself, Assyria
The graven images of the Palaces of Sargon and Sennacherib
However, a beacon totem pole
Mystical, mysterious, the oathbound body of Christ
However, I am myself, a fallen angel"
Four wings, four flights
Mandorla, you who protects
The four heads are
Matthew in the center (human)
John to the right (eagle)
Mark to the left (lion)
Lucas below (bull)
And what's more, we possess four wheels
Ah, we were born empty and thus long not for home
Ah, and then,
That form is one of
Quiet contemplation existing
On the reverse of angelic consideration
Since finite antiquity
