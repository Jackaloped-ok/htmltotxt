Transparent Period of Adolescence
Translation by Yotaka
 (animelyrics.com)
Vanish! Fade away! Melt away!
Get out of my sight,
Anything and everything!
Vanish! Fade away! Melt away!
Get out of my sight,
Instant imposters!
Betrayed by desire
Avenged by hope
I'm already sick of this era
I'll run away
Everyone, disappear!
I no longer want anything at all!
Astride an unmanned sidecar
An imaginary journey of 3000 li
A subway, a freeway, an airport
Let's go, at 100 kilometers an hour
A hero, a swift wind, a fugitive
