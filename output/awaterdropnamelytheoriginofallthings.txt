A Waterdrop, Namely, the Origin of All Things
Translation by Ayu Ohseki
Don ki dijii dandan
Don ki dijii dandan
A labyrinth of invisible time
Several nonexistent futures
The "Rose Garden" solves the riddle
In the words that bring meaning to time
Bring oblivion again to ignorance!
So the meaning of the Nirvanic echo whispers
Escape not to meaningless immortality
Drink the truth, be drunk on wisdom
Don ki dijii dandan
Don ki dijii dandan
Time is always at a standstill
If you attain transcendance, then you will know
The locked-away words to all things, it's said
Net-mesh time is at a standstill
Bring oblivion again to ignorance!
So the time of the Nirvanic echo whispers
Even in cold desert raindrops
May you expose your body to the feeling of ecstasy
Don ki dijii dandan
Don ki dijii dandan
Those innumerable echoes
That resound in a limestone cavern
Are the origin of all life in the world
Riddles, secrets, the rise of the maze
Bring oblivion again to ignorance!
So the water of the Nirvanic echo whispers
The holy chaos of one's lifetime
Implies tradition, heredity
Don ki dijii dandan
A waterdrop, namely, the origin of all things
Don ki dijii dandan
A waterdrop, namely, the origin of all things
Don ki dijii dandan
A waterdrop, namely, the origin of all things
Don ki dijii dandan
A waterdrop, namely, the origin of all things
