Internal Clock, Municipal Orrery
Translation from Nozomi
 DVD Release (2011)
The figure of Death, his head shaking.
The rope tightens, the bell rings.
The rooster flaps, the window opened.
The 12 Apostles, like statues!
Unblinking, a grand parade!
The ancient orrery,
automatic device!
12 constellations of I, the ecliptic.
A zodiac.
I am
the
zodiac!
Inside my body is ancient.
There, a hundred towers stand.
My internal organs, an ideal city.
In the graveyard, church, abbey.
The eyeball of Earth.
An example of motion.
The intellectual organ of stone.
A dynamic constellation.
The incomplete embryo.
Death’s mystery.
Theaters, hospitals, museums.
Manmade flesh. The grotta. The labyrinth.
Illusory construct. Marble.
Manmade clocks. Bells. Springs.
Whirling round and round. Counting time.
From the ancient cities to me…
Ending on that day, the 24-hour clock.
The sun showing at noon…
...and at night, the moon.
Our natural 24-hour clock.
Bong, bong! Ding-dong-ding!
Bong, bong! Ding-dong-ding!
The city of flesh, the mystery of the clock.
Geometric law, rigid construction.
Monotony, eternity.
Present, permanence.
The truth of all creation,
unending sameness.
Infinite variety.
I will take the form of the city of the human body.
I shall take the form of the broken clock.
City, clock, discovery!
City, clock, revelation!
City, clock, annihilation!
