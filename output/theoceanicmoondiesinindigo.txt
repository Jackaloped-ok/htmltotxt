The Oceanic Moon Dies in Indigo
Translation by allegoriest
Perspective, The route to your final journey
I become the wind
I become a breath
I become light and steam
Nocturnal ocean, moon, waves
I go towards those indigo depths
Shinigami, the mark of the shadow of death
I become the wind
I become a breath
I become light and steam
Nocturnal ocean, moon, waves
I go towards those indigo depths
Nonetheless, I wasted my life away
As the shadow of death approached
My transpaerent soul was subdued
My lost time from the bottom of the oceanic night-
Rising to the surface in the brilliant moonlight
Nostalgic natural contemplation
Metaphysical intuition
All of creation, universal meditation
Deep in the night, the oceanic moon
Panorama Carnival
Undulating moon, Nocturnal moon, Visionary moon, Temporal moon
Gale moon, Breath moon, Drunken moon, Dark Moon
Full Moon, Half moon, Red moon, Blue moon
Lost moon, Shadow moon, Un-moon, Non-moon
Ahh, Crescent moon, Eclipse
Moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon
Moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon
I always go this distance
The genuine extent of insanity
Standing before that forbidden door of the moon
“Now, open the door!”
I become waves
I become darkness
I illuminate the sea
I become the moon
“I am as the moon, and unto the moon,
the moon ascended upon the waves
And from behind those of the waves,
above the region, there I was as the moon.”
memento mori, mento mori,
nto mori, tomori, mori, ri firefly moon
I feel my death
memento mori, mento mori,
nto mori, tomori, mori, ri noctiluca moon
Feel my death
“Moon, cease!”
Even when it comes to waves,
it’s existence without existence
Even when it comes to the sea,
it’s existence without existence
Even when it comes to the moon,
it’s existence without existence
Existence without existence
Existence without existence
Without existence
existence without beginning
existence without me
existence without though
existence without excess
existence without death
