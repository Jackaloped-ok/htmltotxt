Strangerâ€™s Lullaby
Translation by EJ
Heard at the end of a dream
The stranger's lullaby
'Goodbye to me, myself
And an empty hello to this morning'
My beloved shed skin
Everything comes to an end eventually
I am leaving on an eternal journey
Leaving behind my still-warm shed skin
'Goodbye, myself
Goodbye to me, myself
And an empty hello to this morning
Goodbye, myself'
Remembered at the end of a dream
The stranger's lullaby
'Goodbye to me, myself
And an empty hello to this morning'
It drifts down slowly
So light, like the downy hair of your cheek
I am leaving on an eternal journey
Leaving behind the shed skin that I can still remember
'Goodbye, myself
Goodbye to me, myself
And an empty hello to this morning
Goodbye, myself'
Sung at the end of a dream
The stranger's lullaby
'Goodbye to me, myself
And an empty hello to this morning'
Looking to the east, I say 'goodbye'
Looking to the south, I hum
The stranger's lullaby
Leaving behind the shed skin I'll never return to
'Goodbye, myself
Goodbye to me, myself
And an empty hello to this morning
Goodbye, myself'
