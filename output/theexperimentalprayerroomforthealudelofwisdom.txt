The Experimental Prayer Room for the Aludel of Wisdom
Translation by Ayu Ohseki
“In species it is gold
More pure than the purest
Some Alchemists...seek to prepare something of a solid nature
Because they have heard the object of their search described as a Stone
Know, then, that it is called a stone, not because it is like a stone
But only because...of its fixed nature” [1]
The Alchemists
Ahh, alchemy of eternal wisdom
Ahh, laboratory of eternal wisdom
Ahh, aludel theatre of eternal wisdom
The dragon that appeared, not in a dream,
But at the beginning of the world’s creation,
Is much like the gods floating atop the waves
Distillation, sublimation, calcination, conjunction
Reflectance, dissolution, subsidence, coagulation
Everything within the water
Is blacker
Than black itself
And then
In the meantime, it generates
A brilliant, ruby-red shine
Ahh, the blessed green
Through all creation buds the green
God’s mysterious aura of green
The Kabbalah green
The whirling universe
O esotericist, feed the green lion
The philosopher’s fire
The sage’s fire
O bellows
Light a fire in the alchemical furnace, the athanor
Behold!
The philosophical aludel = a laboratory
The cosmic aludel = a laboratory
A poverty-casting laboratory
In total disorder
We shall,
For the worthy humans we wish to be,
Be those who aim for worth:
Alchemists
“On the first occasion projection was made upon Mercury, of which I transmuted a half pound or thereabouts into pure silver, better than that of the mine, as I and others proved by assaying several times. This was done on a certain Monday, the seventeenth day of January 1392, Pernelle only being present. Thereafter, still following--word for word--the directions of my book, about five o’clock in the evening of the twenty-fifth day of the following April I made projection of the Red stone on the same amount of Mercury, still at my own house, Pernelle and no other with me, and it was duly transmuted into the same quantity of pure gold, much better than that of the ordinary metal, softer and more pliable. I speak in all truth. I have made it three times, with the aid of Pernelle, for she...understood the subject as well as myself.” (Nicholas Flamel) [2]
