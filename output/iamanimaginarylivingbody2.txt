I Am An Imaginary Living Body
Translation from Central Park Media
 DVD Release (2002)
Darking burning, Puppets given birth
The name given is anthrocentrism
Controlling the world is a single being
The rest is imagined puppetry
Living things given birth
Linked by anthrocentrism
On natureâ€™s stage are teaching units of existence
Becoming imaginary life form craft
Words are born, then meet and then go astray
Ideas are born, then meet and then oblivion
Oh, where am I and when am I?
Spells, charms, mysteries, prayers, and me
The stage of destiny is a magic mirror
Full moon, mysterious, ever-changing
I am an imaginary life form at my end
Full moon, mysterious, ever-changing
I am an imaginary life form at my end
Pursuing time, Never resting
An empty figure living on
Seeking the land, no arms, no legs
Yet I still exist formless and transparent
I let out a faint sigh
