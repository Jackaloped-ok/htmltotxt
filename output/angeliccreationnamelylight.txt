The pleasure principle.
The Nirvana principle.
The certainty of death, namely light.
Without having lived,
the moving phenomenon of life.
In the universe of the mind
the drifting shape of the living.
Light, temporary existence.
Seeking eternity,
namely the folly
of returning to the beginning.
The two sexes, the two poles,
there are two of me.
Up, down, left, right,
there are two of me.
Front, back, heaven, earth,
two of me.
Angel, devil,
there are two of me.
And inside I'm hollow.
Inside I'm hollow. (repeat)
