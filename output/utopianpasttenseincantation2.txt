Utopian Past Tense Incantation
Translation from Pioneer/Geneon
 Album Release (2005)
Time machine
To the past, To the future...zoom! shazoom!
Time machine
The time when I was a cute child
A carpet of lotus flowers
Playing with dolls
A mysterious charm fii fii
Confetti
Wore a pretty dress
7, 5, 3
Oh my dream machine
A shower of cherry blossoms
It's for me from long ago
Ten two one zero!
Take off!
Time machine
To the past, To the future...zoom! shazoom!
Time machine
To that time of dreams and hopes
Tying the hair back
Carrying the box lunch
Mysterious charm fii fii
An amusement park
How I am surprised
My heart is
Oh my dream machine
A storm of dreams
It's for me from long ago
Ten two one zero!
Take off!
