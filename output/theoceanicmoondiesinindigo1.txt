The Oceanic Moon Dies in Indigo
Translation by Ayu Ohseki
Perspective: the journey to the next world
I will become a breeze
I will become a breath
I will become a will-o'-wisp
The night ocean, moon, waves
I will head for that profound indigo
Thanatos: the seal of the shadow of death
I will become a breeze
I will become a breath
I will become a will-o'-wisp
The night ocean, moon, waves
I will head for that profound indigo
I idled my life away, but nonetheless
I was accompanied by a transparent soul
In the imminent shadow of death
Lost time floats up with more moonlit brilliance
Than the submarine depths of night
Nostalgic natural contemplation
Metaphysical sensation
All things in nature, universal meditation
The oceanic moon late at night
Panorama carnival
Wave moon, night moon, dream moon, time moon
Breeze moon, breath moon, drunk moon, Sheol moon
Full moon, half moon, red moon, blue moon
Lost moon, shadow moon, no moon, non-moon
Ah, crescent moon, lunar eclipse
Moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon
Moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon, moon
I stand before
That ever-receding, forbidden lunar door
Which is so pure it is delusional
"Now, open the door!"
I will become the waves
I will become the darkness
I will illuminate the ocean
I will become the moon
"To lunify, to lunacize,
the moon rose over the ocean
It lunified overhead and from
behind the undulator"
Memento mori, mento mori,
nto mori, to mori, mori, ri: firefly moon
I remember death
Memento mori, mento mori,
nto mori, to mori, mori, ri: noctiluca moon
May I remember death
"Stop, Moon!"
Even if I become the waves,
they too have in them nonexistent existence
Even if I become the ocean,
it too has in it nonexistent existence
Even if I become the moon,
it too has in it nonexistent existence
Nonexistent existence
Nonexistent existence
Inactive existence
Beginningless existence
Egoless existence
Emotionless existence
Unattainable existence
Deathless existence
