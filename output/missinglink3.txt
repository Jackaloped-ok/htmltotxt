Missing Link
Translation by Verthandi
Missing link, ooooh
Missing link, oooh
This is the link that was lost
Though I cut ties with this world,
I continue to transform
O heavenly bodies!
Why do I remain
In this world?
Missing link, ooooh
Missing link, oooh
This is the link that was lost
Though I cut ties with this world,
A power is connected still
O illusion!
Why do I remain
In this time, this place?
Though once unborn,
I yet came to be born;
Most resourceful,
My heart
He who is born will die
He who is born will disappear
Yet, we perservere;
It is quite absurd.
Though I cut ties with this world,
A connection remains
Lo, I have vanished, yet now I am singing
Lo, I have vanished, yet now I am laughing
Lo, I have vanished, yet now I am petrified
Lo, I have vanished, yet now I am living
Missing link, missing link...
