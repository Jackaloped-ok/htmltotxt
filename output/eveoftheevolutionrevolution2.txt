(Eve of the Evolution Revolution)
Translation from Central Park Media
 DVD Release (2000)
The beginning of earth
is on the stage.
It’s a tiny unknown planet
in the immutable Milky Way.
Illusion of infinity
can’t be resolved by time.
Nobody knows what’s waiting
beyond eternity.
An eternal me.
And an eternal somebody.
There’s no relationship,
No connection to earth
other until the moment of encounter
In the constellation of our flesh.
Ahhh!
Time is hypothetical and illusive,
Setting the stage for a new life.
Destiny, choice, and then farewell.
You and I are like the Milky Way.
No past, no future, living for today
All alone in the theater of the universe.
That’s me!
My last evolution…
Revolution…
Evolution…
Last Evolution
