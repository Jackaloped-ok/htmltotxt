--In the Hands of the World--
Translation by Ayu Ohseki
Why the love and hatred of fate?
Why the slaughter and cruelty of destiny?
Heaven's decree has yet to show its form
In the hands of the world
Why the christening as family of fate?
Why the absence and isolation of destiny?
Heaven's decree has yet to show its form
In the hands of the world
Shouldering a destiny harsher than death
In the flow of time unable to come to a halt
You are I are already the everything of nothing
Regardless, we are in the flow of breathing time
Why the birth and prodigality of fate?
Why the life on death's door of destiny?
Heaven's decree has yet to show its form
In the hands of the world
Why the lost nature of fate?
Why the temporal desert of destiny?
Heaven's decree has yet to show its form
In the hands of the world
The cradle of breath, All Things over a long distance
In the flow of time unable to come to a halt
Movement, circulation, in other words, inaction
Regardless, we are in the flow of breathing time
Ah, over the world's palms
We are isolated and among several millions
Only that time
Only that moment
Only just waiting for it
Only while waiting for it
Only waiting for it
In the hands of the world
In the hands of the world
Cradled in the Grave of the World
