Missing Link
Translation from Central Park Media
 DVD Release (2003)
Missing link...
Missing link...
The lost link in the chain.
I am disconnected...
Though I continue to evolve.
Stars up above
Why do I
exist in this world?
Missing link...
Missing link...
The lost link in the chain.
I am disconnected...
Though I have the power to join.
Mirage before me
Why am I
here now?
I did not want to be born
and yet I was born all the same.
Though it marks
my beginning
My birth leads to my death.
My birth leads to annihilation.
The repetition,
so absurd
I am disconnected
and yet I am still connected
See, I have vanished yet still I sing.
See, I have vanished yet I still smile.
See, I have vanished yet I am petrified.
See, I have vanished yet I still live.
I am still here. I still exist.
I am still here. I still exist!
