Dona Dona (Episode 16)
Translation from Nozomi
 DVD Release (2011)
On a lazy, sunny afternoon on the road to the marketplace
A wagon rattles along
carrying a calf within.
The precious calf is going to be sold.
Such a sad look the calf's eyes hold.
Dona Dona Dona Dona The calf rides on inside.
Dona Dona Dona Dona The wagon sways from side to side.
Dona Dona Dona Dona The calf rides on inside.
Dona Dona Dona Dona The wagon sways from side to side.
A blue sky above, a gentle breeze blowing, swallows flying to and fro
A wagon heads to the market
carrying a calf within,
If only he
had wings
he could return to his happy pasture.
Dona Dona Dona Dona The calf rides on inside.
Dona Dona Dona Dona The wagon sways from side to side.
