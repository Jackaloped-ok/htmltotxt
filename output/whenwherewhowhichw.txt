Translation by allegoriest
When Where Who Which
When Where Who Which
Blood of the cage of memory flows
of the cradle of a thousand years of fortune
I am an actor,
eternally to represent
the Sphinx
phinx of the desert winter
Of the mortality of newborn flesh
Are the winds of sadness you too know
The holy actor, eternally to represent
the marginaux
of darkness and light, fallen to hell
Shine, burn!
Fade, sing!
Born into the world
Instantaneous birth
Such repetition
