Philosophical existence
Popular magic's territory of
Grand-Guignol
A heave, a sigh
A last gasp, a sigh of grief, a snort
A collection of sighs, a storing
container of sighs,
a magnifying glass
A sigh, a heave
A last gasp, a sigh of grief, a snort
A sigh, a heave
A last gasp, a sigh of grief, a snort
A sigh, a heave
A last gasp, a sigh of grief, a snort
A sigh
Ha ha hah
There is no energy in lock, stock and barrel!
There is no useless energy in everything!
An absolute being is a breathing machine
An absolute being is an anatomical model of
the human body of meat
Absolute decomposed pickled scallions
An absolute being is the ultra synthesis
Ah, ah celestial revolution
Ah, ah existence synthesis
Is it a birth of a new species?
Is it the wreck of one's former self?
Whichever is dry and hard
Here goes the pit-a-pat
Of a hammer striking time
Dot dot dot dash
I open the door as I go through time!
