Seal Spell
Translation from Nozomi
 DVD Release (2011)
The unmarked Seal Spell.
The Iron Mask of misfortune.
Blue skies and oceans, then a wind blows.
The prairie, rabbits, and even a flowing river.
Time and the age, they never change.
Times and the age,
they're something yet nothing.
Man is described by the blood of "make-believe."
Man is also swept away in a current of "lessons."
Man can also only convey
human nature.
Ever unchanging!
We can see during the day but we can't see at night.
We can see at night but we can't see during the day.
Anagram.
A mysterious sword, a mask of words.
And their origin is ... you!
