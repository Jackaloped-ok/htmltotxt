Angel Creation, Namely Light
Translation from Pioneer/Geneon
 Album Release (2004)
A light of all creation
A light of mosaic
A child of dawn, Angel Lucifer
A light of the apocalypse
A light of Michael
A child of darkness. Androgynous
A light of flame
A light of heaven
The hierarchy of heaven
A light of illusion
A light of eternity
A trick fantasy
A whim is born
Nix (moonless night)
Erebus (faintly darkness)
Uranus (star sky)
Thanatos (death)
Brightly shinning body.
Gyes
a spherical shape
Gyes
was born into every possible miracle
A pleasure principle
A nirvana principle
Inevitability of death. that is light
Not living
A phenomenon of moving life
In the universe of the cerebrum
Drift about a form of life
A light of hope appears provisionally
A period of eternity!
That is to return to the
origin of imperfection
The two sexes the opposite poles
There are two types of myself
Top and bottom left and right
There are two types of myself
Front and back heaven and earth
There are two types of myself
An angel a devil
There are two types of myself
