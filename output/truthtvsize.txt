truth (TV Size)
Translation from Nozomi
 DVD Release (2011)
Missing truth and forever,
kissing love and true your heart.
Hold me right with your arms so true.
The key to unlock tomorrow is reality.
I want to keep smashing lies apart.
No matter how much the two of us may talk
you still just can't see anything.
Excuses are fitting for adults who
just cling to old stories.
The angels who weren't chosen
don't need wings to fly!
Missing truth and forever,
kissing love and true your heart.
I like who I'll be tomorrow
I'll believe in myself because I want to believe.
I want to be hated by lies.
