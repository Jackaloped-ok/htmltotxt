Inhuman Illusory Soul Fusion Magic
Translation from Central Park Media
 DVD Release (2002)
There are good spirits and
there are bad spirits
Ah, even if the atmosphere of heaven is brought here
In the depths of hell there is good
and evil, too!
Even if the evil fumes of hell are carried here
So long as they come to us cloaked in doubt
Their eternal dialogue will never end!
On a ghastly moonlit night
When I'm frozen with fear the evil spirits appear
A wonder beyond man's knowledge
A sight which mankind, dwarfed by his creator
Can only look at in fear!
