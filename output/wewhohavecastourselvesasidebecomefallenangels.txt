We Who Have Cast Ourselves Aside Become Fallen Angels
Translation by Verthandi
"With the traces of wings on our backs,
We become capricious angels."
The children of Man
For the reason of feeling,
Named with the names of the children of Man.
The children of Man
For the reason of feeling,
Remained in the world of the children of Man.
With such riddle-sowing wisdom, we forgot ourselves on the way.
By the host of Heaven, our
Holy wings: severed, delivered;
Fallen from Providence, we Children of Dawn,
We are ones who live capriciously.
"We who do not take example have all
Cast ourselves aside to become fallen angels."
Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones.
Sovereignity, Power, Faculty.
"We who do not take example have all
Cast ourselves aside to become fallen angels."
An echo crossed over,
Into the darkness of the age of schola.
Angelic Doctorate: Doctor Angelics
(Thomas Aquinas' book), now absent,
Gave forth a great roar.
Seraphic Doctorate: Doctor Seraphics
(Bonaventura's discourse on angels) also growled mightily.
"We who do not take example have all
Cast ourselves aside to become fallen angels."
Holy Scripture, Isaiah, Ezekiel,
Moses, Solomon, the age of Old Testament.
I am myself, Assyria.
The palaces of Sargon and Sennacherib's statues;
The particular mark on the totem pole.
Mystery, wonderous Eucharist;
However, I am myself a fallen angel.
Four wings and four wings,
Mandorla; thou guardian.
Our four heads are
Matthias at the center (the man)
Iohannes on the right (the eagle)
Marco on the left (the lion)
And Luca beneath (the bull).
Furthermore, we carry four wheels.
Ah, for the sky-birth, I am not homesick.
Ah, therefore,
That form has become
From antiquity, End;
Reverse of angelic thought;
Quiet mediation.
