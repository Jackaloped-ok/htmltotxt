The beginning of the universe,
namely the opening of destiny
The creation of heaven and Earth,
namely the birth of destiny
The legend of Genesis,
namely the creation of destiny

namely selection by destiny

It is our mirror
Even so
That appearance
Are we flesh?
Even so
Eternity
Absence
We become
Only
A fortuity
