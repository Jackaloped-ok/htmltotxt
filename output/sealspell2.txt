Seal Spell
Translation from Central Park Media
 DVD Release (2000)
The unrecorded spell of captivity.
The unfortunate Iron Mask.
Though there are blue skies,
The oceans, the wind blowing…
There are fields with rabbits and rivers flowing.
Times and the age, they never change.
Times and the age,
they’re something, yet nothing.
Human affairs, a game recorded in blood.
Human needs, swept away in the river.
All we are told
is that people are people.
No change at all!
What we see in the day
We can’t see in the night.
What we see in the night
We can’t see in the day.
Anagram.
A mysterious word, a mask of words.
And their origin is…
You!
