Earth Prison Panopticon
Translation by Katie
Monitored by the Panopticon (full-view surveillance prison),
We become solitary prisoners of the world-prison
That is already the same as a machine
Connecting like screws and hinges
Transmitting: pipe, tube, hose
Monitored by the Panopticon (full-view surveillance prison),
We become solitary prisoners of the world-prison
There we contemplate:
Let’s know even further isolation.
Let’s enter even further isolaton.
Let’s anticipate even further isolation.
Isolation-lation, isolation-lation
Isolation-lation, isolation-lation
Isolation-lation, isolation-lation
Isolation-lation, isolation-lation
Aaah
Aaah
Monitored by the Panopticon (full-view surveillance prison),
We become solitary prisoners of the world-prison
At the end, I wish to
Fly through the air,
go ten thousand miles in the deep sea,
Invent all forbidden machines
Become lost from public memory
