Hello, My Baby
Translation from Nozomi
 DVD Release (2011)
Hello to you, little babe. To your smiling face.
Hello to you, little babe. To your cries, as well.
Those little hands you have! Your eyes, squeezed tightly shut!
How do you do? I'm your mother, dear.
(The rest doesn't play in the episode.)
Hello, My Baby        Translated by Ayu Ohseki
Hello, my baby! Your smile
Hello, my baby! Your cries
Your tiny hands and round eyes
How do you do? I'm Mommy!
Hello, my baby! Your life
Hello, my baby! Your future
This happiness is what Daddy desires
How do you do? I'm Mommy!
This is the mark of love for the two of us alone
I'll pray to raise you healthy and beautiful
Hello, my baby! I have a request
Hello, my baby! Sometimes, Daddy and I
You see, we want you to make a quiet night
Just for us--so good night
Please, my baby
Good night, my baby! I'm Mommy!
Hello, My Baby
Translated by Verthandi
Hello, my baby's face
Hello, my baby's cry
Your tiny hand, your round eyes
It's nice to meet you, I'm your mama!
Hello, my baby, to your life
Hello, my baby, to your future
Papa wished for this happiness
It's nice to meet you, I'm your mama!
As a symbol of our love, I pray
To bring you up healthy and beautiful
Hello, my baby, I have but one request
Hello, my baby...sometimes, I would
Like to have a quiet evening
Alone with Papa, so goodnight
Please, my baby...
Goodnight, my baby. I'm your mama!
