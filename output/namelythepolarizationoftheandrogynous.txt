-Namely, the Polarization of the Androgynous-
Translation by Ayu Ohseki
Set baby Christ on your knee
Overhead the chorusing Virgin Mary
By a single thread was it suspended:
An ostrich egg
That egg evoked mysterious feelings
Due to perspective, it symbolized world harmony
An invisible light radiated from within the egg
A mysterious light
Immaculate conception
Abandoned in the desert
Lies an ostrich egg
By the heat of the sun
Naturally incubates
The ostrich egg
Namely, it is
The World-Egg
The Cosmic Egg
A single boundless miracle of expansion
An unrestricted, undying, live egg of power
Chaos cosmos
The perfect world
Has never had anything stolen from it
Nor has anything ever been added to it
The never-owned perfect shape
The completion that includes the secrets of life
The Cosmic Egg
Split in two:
Heaven and earth
Day and night
Sun and moon
Fire and water
Man and woman, thus
Forcing opposites to generate
Namely
The polarization of the androgynous
Uchuuran Purotogonosu
