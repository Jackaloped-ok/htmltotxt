Initiation to the Secret Formula of Love-
Translation by Ayu Ohseki
Poliphilo
The love-key of allegorical, fictional dreams
The garden of arbitrary, imaginary dreams
The irresistible tale
Of a dream for antiquity
A battle for love
Within his slumbering
The tale of the blue rose
Symbol of Christian abstinence: Diana
Symbol of pagan lust: Venus
Seduced by a terribly strange singing voice
To an earnestly sweet dream’s antiquity
They say a dream dreamed at dawn
Is a dream that narrates the truth
The fictional Polia’s female longing
April sap
Flowers bloom in abundance
At last
A vast, dark forest
Dew on the grass
Memories of suckling during toddlerhood
An obelisk that towers over the pyramids
The pegasus statue
At last, he finally reaches
The ritual gate
The light of a tiny lamp
He begins to spin imaginary threads
Ahh
Platonic female yearning
Ahh
Sing praise to sensuality and dream, a picture album of love and dreams
An erotic battle
Within his dream
Namely
Initiation to the secret formula of love
The fictional Polia
Casts off Diana’s abstinence
The fictional Polia
Heads for Venus’s pleasure
Cupid’s carriage
Cythera’s fountain
A pure white tunic
Yet upon finally reaching her, he finds
A dream, again a dream’s strife of love in a dream
The future Hypnerotomachia
Mirai no Hyupunerotomakia
