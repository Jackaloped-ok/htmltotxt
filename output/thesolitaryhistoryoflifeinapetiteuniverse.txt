The Solitary History of Life in a Petite Universe
Translation by Ayu Ohseki
A tiny existence at the bottom of a retort
Couspeau Deum, child of the dragon
The natural magic of atavism
"I am here
I am slight, therefore
I am here"
A prehistoric destiny appendix
Child of mystification
The birth of a lifetime repeats
"I am here
I am subtle, therefore
I am here"
Partiality, and
Strange habits, and
A mutation, and
Running wild, and
Ignorance
Immorality
Unfeeling
Uncultured
Rudolph Grotto Labyrinthos
In the realm of pure thought
Rudolph Grotto Labyrinthos
In the realm of poetic creation
Rudolph Grotto Labyrinthos
In the realm of misbegotten experiments
Rudolph Grotto Labyrinthos
In the realm of psychological silence
As I extend over and dissolve into
The tone of a flageolet, and become the air
"I am here
As I become the breath of the waterdrop theatre
The steam of the petite opera"
Solitude
Yes
Solitude, solitude, solitude, solitude......
