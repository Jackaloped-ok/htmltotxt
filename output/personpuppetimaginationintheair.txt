Person-Puppet -Imagination in the Air-
Translation by Ayu Ohseki
I am ethereal
I am the world’s
Optical illusion, its trompe-l’œil
Natural magic
Preferential magic
Giambattista della Porta
What a curious
Collective perspective
Ah, micro-cosmos
From an atom
To the universe
Swirls the mosaic of wisdom
More important than artistic imagination
Is scientific imagination
Ah, utopist
With a compass
And a set square
The exchange mystery blueprints
Shall swell up
An unimaginable
Species camouflage
Again
A perfect hiding place
God’s labyrinth for those who would be apes
The chirping bird-puppet
The lyre-playing mermaid
The crawling snake-puppet
The laughing crab-puppet
Spiral-wound wonders
Dreamy mechanisms
Infinite variety
Game equipment
And then, people-puppets
Ah, the perfect dream
Reality, rarity, bizarrity, skill, illusion, mirror
It will smash every image there is
And allow the birth of
A whimsical truth, a fallen angel
