L’Etranger’s Lullabye
Translation by Katie
At the end of the dream, I heard
L'Etranger's lullabye.          'To my personal self, I say goodbye,
And to this morning's emptiness, hello.'
To the empty shell of my beloved self,
Given time, everything will end, will die.
I embark upon an eternal1 journey,
Leaving my still-warm body behind.
Goodbye, myself.
And to this morning's emptiness, hello.
Goodbye, myself.'
At the end of a dream,
I remembered
L'Etranger's lullabye'To my personal self, I say goodbye,
And to this morning's emptiness, hello.'
Ever so gently. I soared
Ever so gently, like feathers on a breeze.
I embark upon an endless journey
Leaving my still-remembered shell behind.
Goodbye, myself.
And to this morning's emptiness, hello.
Goodbye, myself.'
At the end of a dream, I sang
L'Etranger's lullabye
'To my personal self, I say goodbye,
And to this morning's emptiness, hello.'
As I head south, 'goodbye.'
As I head south, I sing to myself.
L'Etranger's lullabye.
I leave my still-unchanged shell behind.
Goodbye, myself.
And to this morning's emptiness, hello.
Goodbye, myself.'
