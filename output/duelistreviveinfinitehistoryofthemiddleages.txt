Translation from Nozomi
 DVD Release (2011)
Turn my whole self into the “Middle Ages,”
A schola abstract.
Turn my whole self into the “Middle Ages,”
Paralyzing thoughts.
Turn my whole self into the “Middle Ages,”
An ominous book of prophecies.
Turn my whole self into the “Middle Ages,”
A magical symbol of the soul.
Existence. Creation.
Such wonderful pleasures.
Machine of gears.
Sanctification. Decadence.
The incomplete history.
Gunpowder-flask machine.
The eternal miracle I believe in.
The eternal deity I tested.
Ah, Infinite history of the “Middle Ages.”
Be reborn in me!
Temperamental history.
Ah, be reborn…
Ah, Infinite history of the “Middle Ages.”
“In my eyes.”
“In my two hands.”
“In my blood and breath.”
Be reborn! Be reborn!
Be reborn! Be reborn!
Be reborn! Be reborn!
Be reborn!
The “Middle Ages,” everything of that time!
That room! Those clothes!
Turn my whole self into the “Middle Ages,”
The madness and stupidity.
Turn my whole self into the “Middle Ages,”
Medical astrology.
Turn my whole self into the “Middle Ages,”
The lamented art of death.
Turn my whole self into the “Middle Ages,”
An optical antidote.
Turn my whole self into the “Middle Ages,”
A schola abstract.
Turn my whole self into the “Middle Ages,”
