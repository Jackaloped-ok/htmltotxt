truth
Translation by Takayama Miyuki
 (animelyrics.com)
Missing truth & forever
Kissing love & true your heart
Embrace me with your arms so true
The key to open up tomorrow is reality.
I want to keep destroying lies...
As long as all we're doing is talking,
you won't ever see anything at all.
The guy I want to know is annoying,
he wants me to misunderstand him.
Excuses really suit adults
who hang on to old stories.
Unchosen angels
have no need for wings.
Missing truth & forever
Kissing love & true your heart
I'll like the me of tomorrow.
At least I believe so; I want to believe so, so
I want to keep lies hating me.
You warm yourself
with such memories
The red fruit that I want is invisible to you
Don't notice my sighs.
You'll cry tomorrow, but it'll be too late
Even the slight fever that chooses a gusty night
would be so lovely
Missing truth & forever
Kissing love & true your heart
Like a child in the middle of the night
Seeking love to hold back tears
You keep knocking at the door

Missing truth & forever
Kissing love & true your heart
Hold me in your arms so true
Reality is the key to tomorrow
I want to keep destroying lies
Although we've said this much
I can't see anything from your side
Bothering me, he wants to understand
But I want to be misunderstood by him
Excuses are suited to grown-ups
Who still cling to fairy tales
Unchosen angels even have no
need for wings
Missing truth & forever
Kissing love & true your heart
I believe that I'll love myself tomorrow
And because I want to believe,I want to be hated by lies
Thinking of it
Makes me warm when I'm alone
You can't see the red fruit I desire
Don't get hurt by sighs
Tears only slow tomorrow down
Even a slight fever on a windy night is dear to me
Missing truth & forever
Kissing love & true your heart
Like a child in the middle of the night
I'll stop my tears and search for love
I'll keep pounding on that door
