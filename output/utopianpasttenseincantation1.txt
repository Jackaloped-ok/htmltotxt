Utopian Past Tense Incantation
Translation from Central Park Media
 DVD Release (2002)
Time machine!
Zooming me to the past or the future!
Time machine!
Taking me back to my innocent childhood days
On the lotus blossom carpet
playing with my dolls
That wondrous charm! Fi! Fi!
Confeito
That pretty kimono
Oh my dream machine
scattered cherry blossoms
Taking me to my distant past self
Ten! Two! One! Zero!
Take off!
Time machine!
Zooming me to the past of the future
Time machine!
Back to those days of dreams and hope
My hair tied back
A lunch-box in my hand!
That wondrous charm! Fi! Fi!
Amusement parks
Surprise to me, big peach tree
Somewhere in my heart
Oh, my dream machine!
Scattered dream blossoms!
Taking me to my distant past self.
Ten! Two! One! Zero!
Take off!
