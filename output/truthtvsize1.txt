truth (TV Size)
Translation from Central Park Media
 DVD Release (2005)
Missing truth and forever,
kissing love and true your heart.
Hold me tight with your arms so true.
The key to unlock tomorrow is reality.
I want to keep on smashing lies apart.
No matter how much the two of us may talk
you still just can't see anything.
Excuses are fitting for adults
who just cling to old stories.
The angels who were passed over
don't need wings to fly!
Missing truth and forever,
kissing love and true your heart.
I like who I'll be tomorrow and
I'll believe in myself because I want to believe.
I want to keep on hating lies.
