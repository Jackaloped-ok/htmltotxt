Earth Prison Panopticon
Translation by EJ
Observed within the all-seeing prison Panopticon
We in the prison of Earth are lonely inmates
It has already become like a machine
Held together by screws and joints
With pipes, tubes, and hoses running through it
Observed within the all-seeing prison Panopticon
We in the prison of Earth are lonely inmates
What we think of there:
Let's get to know loneliness more deeply
Let's become lonelier
Let's contemplate loneliness further
Lonelinessness Lonelinessness
Lonelinessness Lonelinessness
Lonelinessness Lonelinessness
Lonelinessness Lonelinessness
Ahhh
Ahhh
Observed within the all-seeing prison Panopticon
We in the prison of Earth are lonely inmates
What we soon wish for:
To fly through the sky,
to be ten thousand leagues under the sea
To invent all the useless machines
To become people without memories
