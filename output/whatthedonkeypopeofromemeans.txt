What ‘The Donkey-Pope of Rome’ Means
Translation by Ayu Ohseki
Middle Ages Bestiaire
Strabo’s Geography
Existence
Pliny the Elder’s Natural History
Thaon’s Bestiary
How curious
Guillaume le Clerc’s
Divine Bestiary are all
Parables of the honest truth
Metaphorically, the elephant sleeps while leaning on a tree
If you wish to capture it, you must chop down the tree
Metaphorically, a lioness gives birth to a stillborn cub
Three days later, the lioness resurrects her cub with a roar
Metaphorically, the allegory of the lioness represents Jesus’s revival
How moralistic they are
How symbolic
The Physiologus originated
In Alexandria, second century AD
Miraculous
Preposterous
But that aside, it has tremendous value
Partiality
Richard de Fournival’s
“The Bestiary of Love“ are all...
And then we finally reach:
Thomas of Cantimpré’s
“On the Nature of Things” (De Natura Rerum)
Baltrušaitis’s
“The Fantastic Gothic“
Konrad von Megenberg’s
“The Book of Nature“
And then
Meidenbach’s
“Hortus Sanitatis“ may all
Break away from nature!
Step into the domain of the fantastic
And revive the themes of ancient times
