 DVD Release (2002)
What a wretched sight
The old warrior pours
All his skill into his sword
So pathetic, a sight now!
The sword misses, slicing the air!
The old man
stumbles and falls!
The burning summit
Is split by thunder!
Pyrrhus,
deafened temporarily!
Sword raised into the sky
as though to strike him dead!
Pyrrhus, unable to move!
Pyrrhus finally regains his hatred of his enemy!
He brings his bloody sword down
upon the aged king!
