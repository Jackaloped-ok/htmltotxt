Geometry and Eros
Translation by Ayu Ohseki
The ball dance of the moon and glass
Light: the reflexive
Geometry and Eros
The ideal city of the forest and grotta
Practicality ignored
The Messidor architect
Is that virtue?
Or is that vice?
Sade and Fourier
Indiscriminate eroticism
House of pleasure
Sexual experimentation
Cars and lake boats
Indiscriminate utopia
The shape of a city and the shape of society
A 180° transformation of the shape of human consciousness
Maithuna, the mandala copulation of
Symmetrical human reason
Like the Kabbalah esoteric religion
Like the Greek Megalo Meteoron
The ideology of Ledoux’s House of Pleasure
In short
One side is useful to the other
Everything
Has its consciousness determined by its environment
We freely correct our vices
The freedom and upheaval of human reason
And sometimes the paradox of a cruel revolution
