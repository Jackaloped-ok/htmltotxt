Eve of the Evolution Revolution
Translation from Nozomi
 DVD Release (2011)
The origin of the Earth.
A stage setting.
Laplace's
nebula.
A spectator's theory.
Illusion of immutability.
A riddle-solving clock.
The baby carriage
at the end of immortality.
Myself, eternal.
Strangers, eternal.
Two relationships.
Two births.
That mysterious scale,
the human constellation.
Time is hypothetical, illusory.
The stage setting        we create, the moment we are born.
Destiny, choices, the theory of goodbyes.
You and I are the Milky Way.
We have no past, no future, only now.
All alone in the cosmic theater.
That's me! Wait! My last evolution,
revolution,
everlution
