Spira Mirabilis Theatre
Translation by Robert Paige &
            Utena Translation Project (1998)
The theatre, gifted spirits, a collective phenomenon.
The theatre, gifted characters,a phantasmic reality.
Operating table,a shipwreck,pure drama...
spira mirabilis
Still spiraling, transforming, in the vortex.
spira mirabilis
in Scipio's dream
The theatre illusory spirits,
movement of immortality
The theatre, illusory characters,
structure of immortality
Ammonite, alchemy, scarab...
spira mirabilis
Dying just to live once more.
spira mirabilis
in the vortex of miracles.
mai mai mai mai
mai mai mai mai
Never-ending theatre
On the geometric stage
of life and the mystery of death,
Exeunt, all!
Death rebirth death rebirth
death rebirth death rebirth
Death rebirth death rebirth death rebirth!
