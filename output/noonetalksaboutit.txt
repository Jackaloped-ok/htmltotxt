No One Talks About It
Translation by Yotaka
 (animelyrics.com)
No one has anything to tell
Nothing has anything to tell
Only in the sealed darkness of "yesterday"
Only in the momentary sparkle of "now"
Only in the darkness that waits for the light of           "tomorrow" in the theater
I can become anyone
I can become anything
Only in the sealed darkness of "memory"
Only in the momentary sparkle of "imagination"
Only in the darkness that waits for the light of           "tomorrow" in the theater
Ah, dance, actors of the ancient continental theater
Who put on the mask of time
Ah, dance, coming by the galactic railroad
Your longing, three of the Seven Wonders
Like a star
Like a firefly
Shining and was born, shining and will vanish
Shining and was born, shining and will vanish
We are born and will vanish
Shine and be born, shine and vanish!
Shine and vanish, my soul
Shone and was born, shone and vanished
My star shone and vanished
The best star, my star
Shine and vanish, firefly star
