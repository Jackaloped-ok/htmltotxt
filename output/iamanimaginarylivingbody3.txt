I Am An Imaginary Living Body
Translation by Yotaka
 (animelyrics.com)
Incandescant darkness, birth of puppets
Named the theory of human movement
A single existence controls the world,
All else is imaginary puppet-craft
Sub-zero darkness, birth of living creatures
Relating to the theory of human movement
The units of existence on the natural stage
Become an art of imaginary creatures
Words, birth, encounter, and then hesitation
Knowledge, birth, encounter, and then nothingness
Oh where and when am I?
Spell, charm, mystery, prayer, myself
Stage, destiny, sorcery, mirror
Full moon, mysterious and protean,
I am an imaginary living body come to its end
Full moon, mysterious and protean,
I am an imaginary destined body come to its end
Seeking time, without rest
Living on as a troglodyte
Seeking land, without hands, without feet,
I continue to exist, transparent, intangible,
a faint sigh
I Am An Imaginary Living Body
Translation  by  Robert Paige, Yasuyuki
 Sato & Utena Translation Project (1998)
Incandescent darkness and birthed puppets
Are named, anthropoperipherism
Pulling the strings of the world is a single existence
For the others, an imaginary puppet-craft
Subzero darkness and birthed creatures
Correlated, anthropoperipherism
On the natural stage are the units of existence
Comprised of an imaginary creature-craft
Words are born, the encounter, then a hesitation
Knowledge is born, the encounter, then a void
O where am I, when am I
Spell, incantation, mystery, prayer, myself
Stage destiny magic mirror
Full moon, mysterious and transmutable,
I'm an imaginary living body come to its end
Full moon, mysterious and transmutable,
I'm an imaginary destined body come to its end
Seeking time, without rest
Living on, a speleomorph
Seeking land, armless, legless
Still existing I am, transparent, intangible,
a faint sigh...
