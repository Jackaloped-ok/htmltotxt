«Out from the Wilderness»
Translation by Ayu Ohseki
Is it the vigor of blood that is trembling?
Or else is it because I was a soldier long ago?
Is it the repose of the heart that is sinking?
Or else is it because I had lost it long ago?
The wind calls out, "Know thy name
"Know the true name that exists
"In the shadow of mine own"
Is it an oath towards tomorrow that I gaze upon?
Or else is it because I served a master long ago?
Is it for my weakness that I am suffering?
Or else is it because I was locked away long ago?
The wind calls out, "Know thy name
"Know the true name that exists
"In the midst of mine own"
There is a path
Both endless and brief
However, nowhere is there a guidepost
Just, only progress is there for knowing
So that I can know my true name
In order to know your true name
Go forth!
Is it the breath of history that is calling?
Or else is it proof that I lived long ago?
I hear the voice of that which calls me
I hear the voice calling from long, long ago
The wind calls out, "Know thy name
"Know the true name that exists
"At the ends of mine own"
There is a path
Both endless and brief
However, nowhere is there a guidepost
Just, only progress is there for knowing
So that I can know my true name
In order to know your true name
Go forth!
