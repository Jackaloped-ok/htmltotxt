Monastic Reproduction – Becoming – Flesh Apocalypse
Translation by Hiraku
Mucous, Sanguine, Moisture, Bilious
Namely – Flesh Apocalypse
The corrupted air in the nasal fossa
The corrupted sea in the depth of esophageal
The corrupted darkness in the abdominal
Fecal excrement’s erotic reproduction!
Carnal desire, sexual desire, passionate desire, selfish desire
Namely – Formation Apocalypse
Beast of the shadow’s wind dwelling in the heart
Demon’s sea in the deep recess of the soul
Hideous darkness at the end of Libido
Abstinence sorcery’s erotic reproduction!
Blood-painted dialectic
Bile-painted dialectic
Fluid-painted dialectic
Perversion-painted dialectic
Eros – Agape – Gnosis!
Carpocrates – Holy semen!
Hedonistic happiness is to be the destiny
We are the objects that can never reach escape velocity
Forgetting and abandoning that which is I
We lose ourselves in the oblivion of our fetishes, Stagnating!
Yes! Ringing! Forming! Living! Becoming!
Yes! Toiling! Withdrawing! Nulling! Becoming!
