When Where Who Which
Translation by Takayama Miyuki

When Where Who Which
When Where Who Which
The flowing of blood from the cage of memory...
In the cradle of eternal bliss,
I am an actor
cast eternally as a Sphinx
in the desert winter Phinx.
Now you know the sad winds
of stillborn flesh.
And I am a holy actor,
cast eternally
as a darkly shining margineaux that was cast into Hades.
Glow! Burn!
Then cool down, and sing!
Born into the world;
born in an instant
To repeat again
