Missing Link
Translation by Ayu Ohseki
Missing Link, ooh
Missing Link, ooh
A missing link
An unconnected me,
Yet a me continuing to change
Oh heavenly bodies,
Why am I
In this world?
Missing Link, ooh
Missing Link, ooh
A missing link
An unconnected me,
Yet a connected power
Oh illusions,
Why am I
Here right now?
I never wanted to be born,
And yet I was
My heart is just like
An object to be used
To be born and die,
To be born and vanish,
To repeat this,
How absurd!
An unconnected me,
Yet a connected me
Look, now the vanished me is singing
Look, now the vanished me is laughing
Look, now the vanished me is petrified
Look, now the vanished me is living
Missing Link!  Missing Link!
