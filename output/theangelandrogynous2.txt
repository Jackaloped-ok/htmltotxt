The Angel Androgynous
Translation by Verthandi
Pentagram shape
Pleasure
Mandala
Reproduction axis
Ideals and reality
Male and female
Dignity; chastity
A double submission of passion; lusterous waves
A prototype of antiquity connected with me
Seraphitus
A couple equipped with both sexes
Seraphita
Paradise mechanism
Model
Mosaic
A doubling dream
Odd numbers and even numbers
Light and darkness
Individuals or multitudes?
Words or things?
Such doubt is beside symbol,
The Dioskuroi
All Creation, both sexes, chaos
Anima, animus
I hasten my spiritual completion
Namely, to rediscover the interior of my ego
Right and left, the two of me
Angels, all Creation, man and woman, both sexes
A pair of heads; a pair of bodies
An internal pair; an external pair
A pair of sexes; a private pair
A pair before; a pair behind
In this world, I am a solitary duo
In this world, I am alone with myself
In this world, there are but two of me
Two of me
Of me, two
Me: two of
Two of me
In this world, I am androgynous
Ahhh...
Ahhh...
Ahhh...
Ahhh...
Hermaphrodism!
