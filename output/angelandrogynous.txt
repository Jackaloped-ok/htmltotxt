Angel Androgynous
Translation by EJ
A five-scented star
Pleasure
Mandala
Center of reproduction
Ideal and reality
Man and woman
Pride, purity
Double-desire, chaos-charm
I am linked to the ancient design
Seraphitus
The androgynous two
Seraphita
A heavenly device
Shaping
Mosaic
A double dream
Odd numbers and even numbers
Light and darkness
Am I one or many?
The word or the object?
Such questions act as symbols
Dioskouri
All things, both sexes, chaos
Anima, animus
Let us hurry to spiritual perfection
In other words, the rediscovery of what is inside yourself
The two of me, right and left
All things in heaven and earth; both sexes, male and female
Two heads heads, two bodies bodies
Two insides insides, two outsides outsides
Two sexes sexes, two selves selves
Two pasts pasts, two futures futures
The two of me are alone in the world
There are two of me alone in the world
There are only two of me in the world
Two of me
Of me two
Me two of
Two of me
I am androgynous in the world
