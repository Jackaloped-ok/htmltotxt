Medieval Masked Man
Translation by Hiraku
Visor!!!
When the time has come for the sacrificial spiritual war
Dawn arrives as the fortress has been smashed to rubbles
Diving deep beneath the underground of that ancient castle
Enveloped in the iron of flames, is the man of darkness

Medieval Masked Man!!
Searing into the skin is the art of alchemy
Transmutation of metals in this world of illusory mankind
Chanting incantation into this pale, dark evening
Crystal ball subjected to countless endurance experimentation
Visor--
Visor--
Medieval Masked Man!! Visor!!
Million candles		Apothecary workbench
Destiny of the heart of the full moon
Time can also tell the tinkling echos of the gold
All it takes is to seek within your conviction
Visor--

Medieval Masked Man!!
Launch! Send a Darkness Arrow!
I shall release an arrow of darkness!
That enigma - Lightning
That enigma - Cruelty
That enigma - Absence
That enigma - Nothing there is to know
