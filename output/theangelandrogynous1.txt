The Angel Androgynous
Translation from Central Park Media
 DVD Release (2003)
Pentagram
Pleasure,
Mandala
The reproductive cycle
Ideals and reality
Men and women
Dignity, chastity
Carnal pleasures, restraint
I am tied to the dawn of creation
Seraphitus
The two of us, androgynous
Seraphita
One or many
Word or object
The very question as it hangs becomes its symbol
Dios Croix!
All creation, gender, chaos
Anima Animus!
Hurry your spiritual perfection!
Namely, revisit your interior!
Left and right, the two sides of me
All in heaven and earth both the sexes
Two heads, two bodies
Two insides, two outsides
Two breeds, two me's
Two fronts, two backs
I'll make the world just for the two of us!
I'll make it so that we're the only two in the world!
I'll make it so it's only the two of us!
The two,
the deux,
the two,
the deux
I will make the world androgynous!
Hermaphroditism!
