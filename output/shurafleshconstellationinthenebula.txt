Shura -Flesh Constellation in the αψζ Nebula-
Translation from Nozomi
 DVD Release (2011)
Shura, now burning,
Pulsing in hands and feet.
Shura, now feverish,
Unaware of how it will end.
A dark “farewell.”
Throwing off its present self.
Blowing to wild darkness.
The limits of the empty sky.
Shura, now reticent,
Gazing upon the shifting path between God and man.
Shura, now ancient,
If the edge of Heaven becomes ancient.
An ugly “farewell.”
The blood melting,
Like steam,
Then freezing again.
Shura becomes the empty solitude.
Solitude is the existence of emptiness.
Shura, like a firefly fading in hue.
Standing on the edge of the hour of death.
Shura, now silent,
Glory and power become the stars.
Shura, now transforms,
Thunder, lightning, the great darkness.
A tragic “farewell,”
Even to eternity.
Finding a mate…
In the heart of the Earth.
Shura becomes a living star.
And that living star becomes the source.
Shura touches the mystic star and the ages continue.
The core of power - Corona.
