No One Has Anything to Say
Translation from Nozomi
 DVD Release (2011)
No one has anything to say.
There's nothing to be said about anything.
Except in the enclosed darkness called yesterday.
Except in the momentary flash of light called now.
Except in the darkness,
awaiting the light of tomorrow, in the theater.
There's the possibility to be anyone.
There's the possibility to be anything.
Except in the enclosed darkness called memory.
Except in the momentary flash of light called creation.
Except in the darkness, awaiting the light of tomorrow,
in the theater.
Oh, dance! Ancient continental theater...
...of the performers who wear the mask of time.
Oh, dance! Three of the seven wonders that you...
...long for carried here on the Galactic Railroad.
Like a star,
like a firefly.
A flash and it's born, a flash and it fades.
A flash and it's born, a flash and it fades.
Born and then gone, all of us.
A flash and it's born, a flash and it fades.
Born and then gone, I, the jewel.
A flash and it's born, a flash and it fades.
Born and then gone, I, the star.
The first star. I, the star.
A flash and it fades, the firefly star.
