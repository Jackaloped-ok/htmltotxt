Missing Link
Translation from Nozomi
 DVD Release (2011)
Missing link...
Missing link...
The lost link on the chain.
Though I am disconnected...
Even so, I continue to evolve.
Stars up above...
Why do I
exist in this world?
Missing link...
Missing link...
The lost link on the chain.
Though I am disconnected...
Even so, I have the
power to join.
Mirage before me
Why am I
here now?
I did not want to be born...
and yet I was born all the same.
The most resourceful thing.
Would be my heart.
Though I am born, I will die...
Though I am born, I will disappear...
It happens over and over again...
It's so absurd...
Though I am disconnected...
Even so, a connection remains...
See, I have vanished yet I still sing.
See, I have vanished yet I still laugh.
See, I have vanished yet I am petrified.
See, I have vanished yet I still live.
I exist. I am here.
I exist. I am here.
I exist!
