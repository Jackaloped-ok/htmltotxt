At Times, Love
Translation by Verthandi
This rose is our destiny, torn apart
Our two hands were separating
Even when I sleep,
embracing a dream of you,
I reach! to the Ends of the World
At times, a strong love wounds our hearts, but
It gives us dreams.
In the midst of courage
A light will always shine forth
with a single power...
This rose is our destiny, guided
We now meet once more
Whatever time we made
that promise,
Don't forget it! At last we've come so far
At times, a noble love
pierces our hearts to claim them
Protected by the one who protects you,
A light will always shine forth
in a single power
At times,
a strong love wounds our hearts, but
It gives us dreams. In the midst of courage
a light will always shine
Love is strong,
it causes our hearts to move
Therefore the two of us are together
to change the world, surely,
And everything will become a single power
