Inhuman Illusory Soul Fusion Magic
Translation from Pioneer/Geneon
 Album Release (2005)
Be a god's spirit
Be a demon
Ah, even if you bring a flavor of heaven
The truth could be virtue!
As well as evil!
Ah, even if a disaster from hell will be brought
Appearing in such a dubious form
Answer me!
Even it's not so, in the night with a superb moon
I have been longing for you for so long
The mystery of not being reached by human wisdom
A human is manufactured by a dwarf incarnation
A figure of dread coming with terror
