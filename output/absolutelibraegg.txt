Absolute Libra Egg
Translation by Ayu Ohseki
Memory hiding in shadow
Existence whose form was hidden
‘Tis said a place exists where the epic of darkness can be heard
Yes: the libra egg roe spawn
There exists the door to all secrets
However, to enter is forbidden
In the darkness of mystery, I listen
To my voice from when I was a child
‘Tis said a place exists where infinite paradises can be seen
Yes: the libra egg roe spawn
There exists the door to all secrets
However, to enter is forbidden
I hear a moaning voice
The tone color of grief
Never can I meet
My own self
Seeking my existence of red blood and darkness
Never can I meet
My own self
The viridian underwater wind
Never misses a trick
An unimaginable world shall hatch
And henceforth become an absolute miracle
Absolute libra egg roe spawn
Absolute libra egg roe spawn
Absolute libra egg roe spawn
Absolute libra egg roe spawn
Absolute libra egg roe spawn
Absolute libra egg roe spawn
