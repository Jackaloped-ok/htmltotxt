Resurrection! Never-ending history of the "Middle Ages"
Translation from Pioneer/Geneon
 Album Release of OST 8 (2004)
Existence, Creation,
Such mysterious of pleasures,
The Machine of Gears wheel
Sanctification, Decadence
The incomplete history,
The Gunpowder-flask Machine
The eternal miracle I believe in,
The eternal god I test,
Ah, never-ending history of the Middle Ages,
Be reborn in me

The Machine of Gaseous body
A possessed personal
Electrical magician
The Machine of Lightning
Passing a time in the heart beat of the hidden devil
Koto of 100 strings
Why does it play the devil’s tune
Ah, never-ending history of the Middle Ages,
Be reborn in me
Turn my whole self to the Middle Ages
