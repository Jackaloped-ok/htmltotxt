Translation by Katie
Baroque (rock)
The spiral is baroque.
Baroque (rock)
Erotic favor
Ahhhhhh
Bernini's angels,
Puget's Pan
Baroque (rock)
The spiral is loosening.
Baroque (rock)
Motion as the consequence of perpetual motion
Ahhhhhh
Seashells, the antelope
Bacteria, semicircular canals
Freeform curve
Serpentine curve
Spiral curve
Logarithmic spiral
Favoritism is Baroque (rock)
In other words, Baroque is
Moving things
Lasting things
Varying things
In other words, Baroque is
Things shrinking inward towards the center
Things expanding outwards into infinity
Things resonating in perpetual motion, which is eternity
Exploiting the necessity of time
Standing on every margin of inequality
In the decadent, flowing ring of the dance
Make total liberation your aspiration
From the nine circumambulating rings of the dance,
Make total liberation your aspiration
Withdrawing, returning, return: Baroque
Death and rebirth, return: Baroque
Withdrawing, returning, return: Baroque
Death and rebirth, return: Baroque
