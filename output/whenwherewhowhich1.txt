When Where Who Which
Translation from Central Park Media
 DVD Release (1999)
When? Where? Who? Which?
When? Where? Who? Which?
The flow of the blood of memories.
The cradle of a thousand years of bliss.
I am an actor.
Just like the sphinx
In the eternal winter desert. Thinks
You know the winds of sadness
of the body as it’s born and dies.
The holy actor, forever…
Cast into hell.
A margin of darkness and light.
Shining! Burning!
Awakening! Singing!
Born into the world!
Born into the moment!
Over and over again!
