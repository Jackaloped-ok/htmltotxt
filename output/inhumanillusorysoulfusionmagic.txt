Inhuman Illusory Soul Fusion Magic
Translation from Nozomi
 DVD Release (2011)
There are good spirits and
there are bad spirits.
Aah! Even if the fragrance of heaven is brought here.
In the depths of hell there is good
and evil, too!
Aah! Even if the salt of hell is carried here.
Since the forms cloaked in doubt are coming,
speak profoundly.
Though it's false, like the brilliant moon...
I wish to keep my treasure close.
A wonder beyond man's knowledge.
People of the world, so small, feel fear.
That form is the field of battle.
