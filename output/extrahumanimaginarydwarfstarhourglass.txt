Extra-human Imaginary Dwarf Star Hourglass
Translation by EJ
The shadows move
Their power:
Transformation
The darkness returns
Its power:
Revolution
The one who is correct is the one who solves the riddle of people
The soul of the being that exists in this gap
Answer:
What is
The possibility
That only
I
Can go on?
O, human! O, earth! O, eternity!
O, human! O, earth! Endlessly
O, human! O, earth! Ah, death and rebirth
O, human! O, earth! Are simply things that repeat
Virtual birth
Virtual me
Virtual connection
Virtual life
Virtual earth
Virtual planet
Even if you ask a question, there is silence
Because of
All that is
Those who do not know
Those who are not known
A dark-colored dwarf star
Dwarf star
A dark-colored dwarf star
Dwarf star
Dwarf star
Dwarf star
Dwarf star
Dwarf star
It's me
