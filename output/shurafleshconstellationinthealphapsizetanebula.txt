Shura --Flesh Constellation in the Alpha Psi Zeta Nebula--
Translation by Ayu Ohseki
Shura: now, burn bright
In the throb of the fingertips
Shura: now, burn hot
Ignorant of your demise
A dark "farewell"
Casting off the transient body
Blowing in the violent darkness
At the limits of empty space
Shura: now, silence
It fixes a stare at heliocentric heaven and humanity
Shura: now, before death
If at the ends of space it is before death
An obscure "farewell"
Melts into the blood
And just like vapor
Again it cools
Shura is in solitude
And solitude is just then nothingness
Shura: like a firefly, pale and transparent
It stands at the verge of its dying hour
Shura: now, without life
Storms, siroccos, coiling within
Shura: now, glitter bright
In the mane of the constellation nebula
A fearful "farewell"
Near and far
A mask of natural spirits
Will shape my ghost into flesh
Shura: now, stillness
Glory, authority, everyone is a star
Shura: now, it metamorphoses
Thunder, flashes of lightning, the vast darkness
A tragic "farewell"
Will make eternity
Into its significant other
And Terra, into its heart
Shura is a star
And a star is a source of life
Shura: it exposes illusory stars, it conceals multiple eras
The terrifying energy core: corona
Shura: Milky Way
Shura: Andromeda
Shura: Orion
Shura: Cassiopeia
Shura: Kruger
Shura: Cepheus
Shura: Sirius
Shura: Sombrero
Shura: Magellan
Shura: now, the Chandrasekhar limit
Shura: now, the Chandrasekhar limit
Shura: now, the Chandrasekhar limit
