seal spell
iron mask of misfortune
blue skies - sea - then the wind blows
grassland - rabbits - even the river flows
Time, the era does not change.
Time, the era is something existent
and nonexistent.
Man is described by the blood of "make-believe"
Man also drowns in a flood of "lessons"
All the word handed down is that
a man is a man.
Without metamorphosis!
In the daytime I can see it, in the nighttime I cannot.
In the nighttime I can see it, in the daytime I cannot.
Anagram
Those puzzle words, those masks of words
The source of which is... dich!
