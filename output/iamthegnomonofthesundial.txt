An icosahedron making use of the shadows
With the wisdom to measure apparent solar time
I am the gnomon of the sundial
Making the imagination of light my strength
An illusory worship of shadows and time
At the north pole of the heavens, a bar of shadow from the sun
At the south pole of the heavens, a clock hand pointing to shadow
Apparent solar hour
Apparent solar day
Apparent solar month
Apparent solar year

I am the gnomon of the sundial
Understanding of the movement of heavenly bodies
Knowledge of the changing of the seasons
An alchemist of the rhythms of nature
The flow of time; the fountain of wisdom
