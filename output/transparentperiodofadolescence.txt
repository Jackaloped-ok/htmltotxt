Transparent Period of Adolescence
Translation from Nozomi
 DVD Release (2011)
Vanish! Fade away! Melt away!
Disappear!
Any and all around me!
Vanish! Fade away! Melt away!
Disappear!
All you instant imposters!
Betrayed by dreams.
Avenged by hopes.
I've had enough of this age!
I'm going to run!
Everyone, go away!
I don't want anything anymore!
Straddling an unmanned sidecar
taking a fantasy journey of 3000 leagues.
Subway, highway, airport...
Here I go! At 100 kilometers per hour!
The wonder! The hurricane! The fugitive!
