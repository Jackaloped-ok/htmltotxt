We
Made our debut in the Triassic period of the Mesozoic era
Adapted and dispersed
On the border of the Cretaceous period and the Cenozoic era,
the Alamosaurus was completely wiped out

Is it classification or fate?
The dinosaur renaissance
Connecting to Majungasaurus (non-avian-type theropod)
Did you know?
Can the cosmic theater come to you?
