Donna Donna (OST 5 Version)
Translation by Verthandi
Late one sunny day, on the road to market,
A clattering cart bears a calf
The sweet calf, going to be sold,
Watches with sorrowful eyes
Donna donna donna donna, bearing the calf,
Donna donna donna donna, the cart sways along
Donna donna donna donna, bearing the calf,
Donna donna donna donna, the cart sways along
In the blue sky, the swallows wing on a gentle breeze
As the cart bears the calf to market
If only he had wings,
He could fly home to a pleasant pasture
Donna donna donna donna, bearing the calf,
Donna donna donna donna, the cart sways along
Donna donna donna donna, bearing the calf,
Donna donna donna donna, the cart sways along
Donna donna donna, donna donna donna, donna!
