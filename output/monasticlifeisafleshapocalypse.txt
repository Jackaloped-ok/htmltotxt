Monastic Life * Is* A Flesh Apocalypse
Translation by EJ
Phlegm, blood, moisture, bile
In other words, a flesh apocalypse
A filthy wind in the nose
A filthy sea in the throat
A filthy darkness in the stomach
The erotic reproduction of excretion
Lust, passion, desire, selfishness
In other words, a form apocalypse
A shadow-beast wind in the heart
A devil sea in the soul
A repulsive darkness at the end of libido
The erotic reproduction of the witchcraft of abstinence
A dialectic smeared with blood
A dialectic smeared with juice
A dialectic smeared with fluid
A dialectic smeared with dissipation
Eros, agape, gnosis
The holy semen of Carpocrates
Pleasure is destiny
We are subjects who are unable to transcend
Forgetting all about me
We are stagnating in an inclination towards vague oblivion
Yes * we ring * we become * we give birth * we are
Yes * we are * we internalize * we are not * we are
