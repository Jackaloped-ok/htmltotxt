The Oceanic Moon Dies in Indigo
Translation by Verthandi
Distance, my journey to the next world
I become wind
I become breath
I become light and vapor
Nocturnal sea, moon, and wave
I face those indigo depths
Shinigami, the mark of the shadow of death
I become wind
I become breath
I become light and vapor
Nocturnal sea, moon, and wave
I face those indigo depths
Eating lotus did me no good
The shadow of Death drew nigh;
My transparent soul was subdued
Lost time from the depths of night
Surfaces terribly in the moonlight
Nostalgic, natural meditation
Metaphysical sensation
All things in nature, a meditation on Creation
Late at night, the moon in the sea
Panorama carnival
Wave moon, night moon, dream moon, time moon,
Wind moon, breath moon, drunken moon, dark moon
Full moon, half moon, red moon, blue moon
Lost moon, shadow moon, nil moon, anti-moon
Ah, the horned moon, the eclipse!
Moon moon moon moon moon moon moon moon
Moon moon moon moon moon moon moon moon
I always go far
The more rhapsodic, the more pure
I stand before the moon's forbidden door:
"Now, open!"
I become waves
I become darkness
I shine upon the sea
I become the moon
"I am the moon, I am made the moon,
the moon that rose over the sea.
Behind and above the maker of waves,
I was that moon."
Memento mori mento mori
nto mori to mori mori ri, firefly moon
I contemplate my death
Memento mori mento mori
nto mori to mori mori ri, noctiluca moon
Contemplate my death
"Stop, thou moon!"
Though I become the waves,
it is an existance without existance
Though I become the sea,
it is an existance without existance
Though I become the moon,
it is an existance without existance
An existance without existance
An existance without existance
Existance without action
Existance without beginning
Existance without self
Existance without thought
Existance without climax
Existance without death
