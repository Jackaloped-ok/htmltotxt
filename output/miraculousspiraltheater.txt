Miraculous Spiral Theater
Translation by Takayama Miyuki
 (animelyrics.com)
The theatre, extraordinary spirits, a collective phenomenon
The theatre, extraordinary characters, a fanciful reality
An operating table, a shipwreck, pure drama
spira mirabilis
Ever spiralling and transforming in the vortex
spira mirabilis   Aaah...
Scipio's dream
The theatre, fantasy spirits,
the movement of immortality
The theatre, fantasy characters,
the structure of immortality
Ammonite, alchemy, the sacred scarab
spira mirabilis
Dying in order to live once more...
spira mirabilis   Aaah...
...in the vortex of wonders
My My My My
My My My My
Never-ending theatre
From the geometric stage
of the secrets of life and death,
exeunt, all!
Death rebirth death rebirth
Death rebirth death rebirth
