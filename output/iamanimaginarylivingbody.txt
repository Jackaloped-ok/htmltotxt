I Am An Imaginary Living Body
Translation from Nozomi
 DVD Release (2011)
Darkness, burning, puppets given life
The name given is Human Movement Theory.
The world is controlled by a single being.
The rest is imagined puppetry.
Darkness, freezing, creatures given life
Linked by Human Movement Theory
On nature's stage are units on existence.
Comprised of the imaginary art of life.
Words are born, they meet, then hesitate
Ideas are born, they meet, then become empty.
Oh, where am I and when am I?
Spells, charms, mysteries, prayers, me.
Stage, destiny, magic, mirror.
Full moon. Mysterious and ever-changing.
I am an imaginary life form at my end.
Full moon. Mysterious and ever-changing.
I am an imaginary destined form at my end.
Asking for time. Never resting.
Living on, a hollow form.
Seeking land. No arms, no legs.
Yet I still exist. Formless and transparent.
I let out a faint sigh...
