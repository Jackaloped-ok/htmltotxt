Angelic Creation, Namely, Light
Translation by Robert Paige &
            Utena Translation Project (1998)
Nature's light
Mosaic light
Child of daybreak; the angel Lucifer
Apocalyptic light
Michael's light
Child of darkness; androgynous
Fire's light
Heavenly light
Hierarchia of the heavens
Illusory light
Eternal light
Phantasmic deception;
capricious birth
Nyx
Erebus
Uranus
Thanatos
Shining bodies,
all of them spherical,
gynous
just as if born with every miracle,
gynous.
The pleasure principle,
the Nirvana principle
Death's inevitability, dubbed "the light"
Without having to have lived,
Phenomenon of mobile life
In the cerebral universe
Shape of floating life
Glory, ephemery,
hope for eternity!
Incomplete returning to the
primitive beginnings.
Male/female, positive/negative
are the two of me.
Up/down, left/right
are the two of me.
Front/back, Heaven/Earth
are the two of me.
Angel and devil
are the two of me.
The center is hollow
hollow hollow hollow...
