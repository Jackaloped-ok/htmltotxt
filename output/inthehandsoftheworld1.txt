- In the Hands of the World
Translation by Verthandi
Why a fate of love and hatred?
Why a destiny of massacre, cruelty?
Providence does not now reveal its face
In the Hands of the World
Why a fate of love and hatred?
Why a destiny of massacre, cruelty?
Providence does not now reveal its face
In the Hands of the World
Why a fate of love and hatred?
Why a destiny of massacre, cruelty?
Providence does not now reveal its face
In the Hands of the World
Why a fate of love and hatred?
Why a destiny of massacre, cruelty?
Providence does not now reveal its face
In the Hands of the World
Why the lost nature of fate?
Why the temporal desert of destiny?
Providence does not now reveal its face
In the Hands of the World
The cradle of breath; all Creation, distant
In time's unceasing stream
Motion, flow; namely stillness
Although we breath in the stream of time
Ah, in the Hands of the World
We the lonely, how many millions
Only for that time,
Only for that moment,
We wait;
As we wait,
We are waiting
In the Hands of the World
In the Hands of the World
