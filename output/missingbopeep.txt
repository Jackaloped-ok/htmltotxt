Missing & Bo-Peep
Translation by Ayu Ohseki
Know us not!
We are enigmas
We exist
By being not known
Missing bo-peep
We are that which was lost
In the distances
What’s more, we exist invisible
We are beings of contemplation
Missing bo-peep
Inside of time
We are simply pure, and so
We do naught but play in the void
Of a single person’s dream
Missing bo-peep
