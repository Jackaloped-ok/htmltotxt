Virtual Star Embryology
Translation by Yasayuki Sato &

Ancient times, perfect, solitude in the desert
Air, atoms, the planet of causality
Yes, a native child
Conception
The embryo of philosophy
Egg, perfect, the origin in the nest
A stamen, a pistil, one seed
Yes, a native child
Growth
The child of philosophy
And
Lunar Heaven, Mercurial Heaven, Venusian Heaven
Solar Heaven, Martian Heaven, Jovian Heaven
Saturnian Heaven, Sidereal Heaven, Motive Heaven
Further circular infinity without end
A kind of organic engine
A kind of perpetual motion device
Ah, lost motion
I'm a lost motion
And
Moon	Mercury	   Venus
Sun	   Mars	   Jupiter Saturn
Fixed star	 Motive star
Further circular infinity without end
One organic system
One perpetual motion device
Ah, it is an empty movement
That is an empty movement. It is.
