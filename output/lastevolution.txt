Last Evolution
Translation from Pioneer/Geneon
 Album Release (2004)
The beginning of the earth
Stage equipment
Laplace's galaxy
A theory of a stranger
An unchanging fantasy
A riddle-solving clock
The end of indestructibility
A baby carriage
Eternal me
Eternal stranger
The relationship of two
The birth of two
A pair of mysterious scales
A constellation of the human body
Ah-ah-ah-ah
AH-AH-AH-AH
Time is a hypothesis, illusional
The beginning of stage equipment
Destiny, choice, the theory of Good-bye
You and I are the Milky Way
There is no past and no future just present
Theater I am all alone in the universe
That's me! Wait! My last evolution
